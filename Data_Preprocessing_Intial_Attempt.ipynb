Mobile subscriptions, expected to reach 8.9 billion by 2022 [1], would drastically increase the demand of extra capacity with aggregate throughput anticipated to be enhanced by a factor of 1000 [2]. In an already crowded radio spectrum, it becomes increasingly dif\\ufb01cult to meet ever growing application demands of wireless bandwidth. It has been shown that the allocated spectrum is seldom utilized by the primary users and hence contains spectrum holes that may be exploited by the unlicensed users for their communication. As we enter the Internet Of Things (IoT) era in which appliances of common use will become smart digital devices with rigid performance requirements (such as low latency, energy ef\\ufb01ciency, etc.), current networks face the vexing problem of how to create suf\\ufb01cient capacity for such applications. The \\ufb01fth generation of cellular networks (5G) envisioned to address these challenges are thus required to incorporate cognition and intelligence to resolve the aforementioned issues. Cognitive radios (CRs) and self-organizing wireless networks are two major technologies that are envisaged to meet the future needs of such next generation wireless networks.\",\n",

            "    \"text\": \"The rapid proliferation of multi-radio access technology-disparate smart devices has resulted in complicated heterogeneous mobile networks thus making con\\ufb01guration, management and maintenance cumbersome and error-prone. 5G, expected to handle diverse devices at a massive scale, is foreseen as one of the most complicated networks and hence extensive efforts are being carried out for its standardization. In the recent years, SONs, as depicted in \\ufb01gure 3, have gained signi\\ufb01cant attention regarding self-con\\ufb01guration, self-optimization and self-healing of such complex networks. The idea behind SONs is to automate network planning, con\\ufb01guration and optimization jointly in a single process in order to minimize human involvement. The planning phase, which includes ascertaining cells locations, inter-cell connecting links and other associated network devices as well as parameters, precedes the con\\ufb01guration phase [24]. Self-con\\ufb01guration means that a newly deployed cell is able to automatically con\\ufb01gure, test and authenticate itself and adjust its parameters such as transmission power, inter-cell interference etc. in a plug and play fashion [24]. Self-healing allows trouble-free maintenance and enables networks to recover from failures in an autonomous fashion. In addition, it also helps in routine upgrades of the equipments in order to remove legacy bugs. Self-optimization is the ability of the network to keep improving its performance with respect to various aspects including link quality, coverage, mobility and handoff with an objective to achieve network level goals [24]. Since AI-based techniques are capable to handle complex problems in large systems intrinsically, these techniques are now being proposed to achieve Self Organization (SO) in 5G.\",\n",

Self-healing is about automatic fault detection, its classi\\ufb01cation and initiating necessary actions for recovery. Irregularities and anomalies in network may be timely spotted to further restore the system by leveraging different AI based sensing techniques like Logistic Regression (LR), SVM and HMM [25]. Self-optimization includes continuous optimization of parameters to achieve system-level objectives such as load balancing, coverage extension, and interference avoidance. AI techniques that may be exploited to optimize provisioning of QoS to various services mainly belong to the class of unsupervised learning.
