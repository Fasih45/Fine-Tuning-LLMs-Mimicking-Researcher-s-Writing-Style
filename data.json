technology islamabad2information technology university itu lahore the explosive increase in number of smart devices hosting sophisticated applications is rapidly affecting the landscape of information communication technology industry mobile subscriptions expected to reach 89 billion by 2022 1 would drastically increase the demand of extra capacity with aggregate throughput anticipated to be enhanced by a factor of 1000 2 in an already crowded radio spectrum it becomes increasingly difficult to meet ever growing application demands of wireless bandwidth it has been shown that the allocated spectrum is seldom utilized by the primary users and hence contains spectrum holes that may be exploited by the unlicensed users for their communication as we enter the internet of things iot era in which appliances of common use will become smart digital devices with rigid performance requirements such as low latency energy efficiency etc current networks face the vexing problem of how to create sufficient capacity for such applications the fifth generation of cellular networks 5g envisioned to address these challenges are thus required to incorporate cognition and intelligence to resolve the aforementioned issues cognitive radios crs and selforganizing wireless networks are two major technologies that are envisaged to meet the future needs of such next generation wireless networks crs are intelligent and fully programmable radios that can dynamically adapt according to their prevalent environment in other words they sense the spectrum and dynamically select the clearer frequency bands for better communication in the most prevailing conditions in this way crs can adaptively tune their internal parameters to optimize the spectrum usage transmission waveform channel access methods and modulation schemes with enhanced coverage however it is due to the recent advancements in machine learning software defined radio sdr that cr is able to emerge from simulation environment to the realtime applications 3 the overwhelming traffic growth coupled with the greedy approach towards high quality of service qos has been a major challenge for current wireless systems in terms of network resources and qos a new paradigm for wireless communication called 5g has been envisioned to address these challenges the major component of the envisioned 5g scheme is self organizing network son son is a relatively new concept in perspective of wireless cellular networks it refers to an intelligent network that learns from its immediate environment while autonomously adapting accordingly to ensure reliable communication in fact son underlines new aspect for automation of future networks in 5g era the sensing learning and reasoning behavior of both crs and son is achieved by extensively using artificial intelligence ai and machinelearning techniques the crs are an evolved form of sdrs realized by the embodiment of cognitive engine ce that exploits the ai techniques for the cognitive behavior to decide optimally the cr network crn follows the cognitive cycle for unparalleled resource management and better network performance cognitive cycle as illustrated in figure 1 begins with sensing of dynamic radio environment parameters subsequently observing and learning recursively the sensed values for reconfiguration of the critical parameters in order to achieve the desired objectivesarxiv170202823v1 csni 9 feb 2017fig 1 learning process in cognitive radios cognitive cycle is elaborated in figure 2 which highlights the parameters that cr needs to quantify in order to utilize the available spectrum without affecting primary users performance the sensed parameters are treated as stimuli for achieving different performance objectives for instance minimizing the bit error rate or minimizing the power consumption etc 4 to achieve the aforementioned objectives cr adaptively learns deciding optimal values for various significant variables such as power control frequency band allocation etc 4 fig 2 the cognitive cycle of cr cr incorporates machine learning techniques for dynamic spectrum access dsa and capacity maximization aibased techniques for decision making such as optimization theory markov decision processes mdps and game theory is used to encompass a wide range of applications 3 the popular learning techniques used in cognitive cycle are support vector machine svm artificial neural networks anns metaheuristic algorithms fuzzy logic genetic algorithms hidden markov models hmms bayesian learning reinforcement learning multiagent systems fuzzy logic theory has been used for effective bandwidth resource allocation interference and power management 3 5 6 7 genetic algorithms gas have been employed for crs spectrum and parameters optimization 8 9 10 anns have been incorporated to improve the spectrum sensing and adaptively learn complex environments without substantial overhead 11 12 game theory enables crns to learn from its history scrutinize the performance of other crns and adjust their own behavior accordingly 13 14 in multiagent domain reinforcement learning rl a rewardpenalty based technique which reinforces immediate rewards tomaximize long term goals has been employed for efficient spectrum utilization 15 minimum power consumption 16 and filling the spectrum holes dynamically 17 svm a supervised classification model is being utilized for channel selection 18 adaptation of transmission parameters 19 and beamforming design 20 in crns hmms have been widely used to identify spectrum holes detection 21 spectrum handoff 22 and competitive spectrum access 23 the range of aibased techniques are not limited to the above mentioned applications other applications of ai in crns are expressed in 3 4 by combining increasing spectrum agility context aware adaptability of cr and ai techniques cr has become an increasingly important feature of wireless systems ieee 80216h has recommended cr as one of its key features and a lot of efforts are being made to introduce cr features in 3gpp lteadvance the rapid proliferation of multiradio access technologydisparate smart devices has resulted in complicated heterogeneous mobile networks thus making configuration management and maintenance cumbersome and errorprone 5g expected to handle diverse devices at a massive scale is foreseen as one of the most complicated networks and hence extensive efforts are being carried out for its standardization in the recent years sons as depicted in figure 3 have gained significant attention regarding selfconfiguration selfoptimization and selfhealing of such complex networks the idea behind sons is to automate network planning configuration and optimization jointly in a single process in order to minimize human involvement the planning phase which includes ascertaining cells locations intercell connecting links and other associated network devices as well as parameters precedes the configuration phase 24 selfconfiguration means that a newly deployed cell is able to automatically configure test and authenticate itself and adjust its parameters such as transmission power intercell interference etc in a plug and play fashion 24 selfhealing allows troublefree maintenance and enables networks to recover from failures in an autonomous fashion in addition it also helps in routine upgrades of the equipments in order to remove legacy bugs selfoptimization is the ability of the network to keep improving its performance with respect to various aspects including link quality coverage mobility and handoff with an objective to achieve network level goals 24 since aibased techniques are capable to handle complex problems in large systems intrinsically these techniques are now being proposed to achieve self organization so in 5g fig 3 illustration of aibased selforganization in the networks selfconfiguration in cellular networks refers to the automatic configuration of initial parametersneighbouring cells listfig 4 ai algorithms for 5g ip addresses and radio access parametersby a node itself ai techniques like dynamic programming dp rl and transfer learning tl may be employed in 5g to automatically configure a series of parameters to render best services rl as opposed to dp which initially builds the environment model to operate is a model free learning technique that iterates through to reach optimal strategy and may yield superior results in dynamically changing radio conditions 25 selfhealing is about automatic fault detection its classification and initiating necessary actions for recovery irregularities and anomalies in network may be timely spotted to further restore the system by leveraging different ai based sensing techniques like logistic regression lr svm and hmm 25 selfoptimization includes continuous optimization of parameters to achieve systemlevel objectives such as load balancing coverage extension and interference avoidance ai techniques that may be exploited to optimize provisioning of qos to various services mainly belong to the class of unsupervised learning besides gradient boosting decision tree a supervised learning technique spectral clustering oneclass svm and recurrent neural networks are few examples in this regard 25 figure 4 summarizes the ai algorithms that can be utilized to enhance cellular networks performance ai techniques may also exploit network traffic patterns to predict future events and help preallocate network resources to avoid network overloading furthermore usercentric qosprovisioning across tiers of heterogeneous cells may also be granted using ai 25 similarly gas are employed for cell planning and optimization of coverage with power adjustment 26 gas are also suited for the problem of finding the shortest path routing in a large scale dynamic networks 27 wenjing et al in 28 proposed an autonomic particle swarm compensation algorithm for cell outage compensation the study in 29 introduces the selfoptimization technique for the transmission power and antenna configuration by exploiting the fuzzy neural network optimization method it integrates fuzzy neural network with cooperative reinforcement learning to jointly optimize coverage and capacity by intelligently adjusting power and antenna tilt settings 29 it adopts a hybrid approach in which cells individually optimize respective radio frequency parameters through reinforcement learning in a distributed manner while a central entity manages to cooperate amongst individual cells by sharing their optimization experience on a network level 29 cells iteratively learn to achieve a tradeoff between coverage and capacity through optimization since increase in coverage leads to reduction in capacity while additionally improving energy efficiency of the network 29 anns can also beeffectively utilized for the estimation of link quality 30 mobile devices in an indoor environment have also been localized through the use of anns 31 in fact aibased techniques enable network entities to automatically configure their initial parameters before becoming operational 24 adaptively learn radio environment parameters to provide optimal services 25 autonomously perform routine maintenance and upgrades and recover from network failures 24 25 in view of the continued proliferation of smart devices we anticipate that crs and son will soon become the basic building blocks of future wireless networks these technologies will transform future networks into an intelligent network that would encompass user preferences alongside network prioritiesconstraints ai being the basis of both these technologies will continue to drive ongoing 5g standardization efforts and therefore be the cause of a major paradigm shift ai techniques will continue to intervene future networks finding their usage in from radio resource management to management and orchestration of networks in fact we anticipate that future wireless networks would be completely dominated by ai references 1 p cerwall ericsson mobility report mobile world congress edition 2016

        "prompt": "i i ntroduction the idea that networks should learn to drive themselves is gaining traction 11 taking inspiration from selfdriving cars where driving and related functionality do not require human intervention the networking community wants to build a similar cognitive control in networks where networks are able to configure manage and protect themselves by interacting with the dynamic networking environmentwe refer to such networks as cognitive selforganizing networks cson the ex pected complexity and heterogeneity of cson makes machine learning ml a reasonable choice for realizing this ambitious goal recently artificial intelligence ai based cson have attained a lot of attention in industry and academia in 2003 clark et al 8 proposed that ml and cognitive techniques should be used for operating the network this knowledge plane incorporation will bring many advantages in networks such as automation of network management efficient and realtime anomaly and intrusion detection and many related tasks due to limited computational resources and lack of ml abilities the idea of knowledge plane was not implemented in networks in recent years the field of ml especially neural networks have evolved rapidly and we have witnessed its success in vision speech and language processing this huge success motivated networking research community to utilize deep ml tools for building cson deep ml or deep learning dl is a branch of ml where hierarchical architectures of neural networks are used for unsupervised feature learning and these learned features are then used for classification and other related tasks dl classifiers are function approximators that require a lot of data for generalization although they have outperformed all other statistical approaches on large datasets due to generalizationerror they are very vulnerable to adversarial examples adver sarial examples are carefully crafted perturbations in the input which when mldl algorithms are subjected to get classified in a different class with high probability in this paper we take security to encompass the securing of all of the functional areas of cson ie iso defined func tional areas often abbreviated as fcaps fault configuration accounting performance and security and experiment with multiple adversarial attacks on mldl based malware clas sification systems our experimental results demonstrate that the current state of the art mldl based networking solutions do not have substantial deterrence against adversarial attacks specifically our experiments utilize the highly cited malware image dataset provided by nataraj et al 28 to perform adversarial attacks on malware classifier to demonstrate that using current mldl techniques in conjunction with csons can be a potential security risk contributions in this paper we have made the following contributions to the best of our knowledge we have made the first attempt to show that cson utilizing mldl techniques are very vulnerable to attacks based on adversarial per turbations we have argued that existing defenses to overcome ad versarial perturbations are not appropriate and efficient for cson

mlbased solutions for networking appli cations have been proposed the networking community has not yet standardized any mlbased solutions for csons this arises partly from the complexity of the cson

human intervention as selfdriving networks jiang et al 17 highlighted the ben efits and challenges in developing an intelligent datadriven network with the ability of learning from dynamic nature of the networking environment by using exploration and exploitation processes koley et al 19 proposed and provided a frame work for zerotouch networking and highlighted the need for cson using googles infrastructure network as an example mestres et al 26 revisited the possibilities of embedding artificial intelligence in networking and proposed an mldl based knowledge plane for networking applications and this new networking paradigm was termed as knowledge defined networking while mldl applications will be a core part of cson recent studies demonstrated that mldl models are very susceptible to adversarial examples 23 1 although most existing studies in this domain have targeted image classi fication applications in which highdimensional images are perturbed in a way that fools the algorithm without being the change being conspicuous to naked human eye these attacks also pose a significant challenge to cson since the underlying algorithms are largely similar such adversarial attacks are performed to compromise the integrity in terms of misclassification accuracy reduction targeted misclassification or decision boundary evasion of the mldl techniques we can divide these adversarial attacks into two broader categories based on the adversarysattackers knowledge whitebox attack this attack assumes that the adver sary has complete knowledge about the mldl architec ture training data and hyperparameters for adversarial attacks on cson we assume a whitebox attack setting blackbox attack this attack assumes that the ad versaryattacker has no information about the mldl technique and hyperparameters the adversary acts as a standard user who can query the mldl based system and gets a response these queryresponse pairs are laterused for crafting the adversarial examples most of the adversarial attacks are whitebox attacks but whitebox adversarial examples can be converted into black box attacks by exploiting the mldl transferability property 29 since these adversarial attacks on ml algorithms have not yet been applied much in the case of networks we will initially review their applications in other domains szegedy et al 34 proposed the first successful adversarial attack that has fooled the state of the art image classifiers with very high probability goodfellow et al 12 proposed an adversarial sample generation method called fast gradient sign method where adversarial perturbation was generated by taking the sign of the gradient of the cost function with respect to the input kurakin et al 20 explored the vulnerability of mldl techniques in the physical world and demonstrated that a small invisible tweak to the input of an mldl techniques can result in incorrect results carlini et al 7 proposed three attacks by exploiting the three different distance matrices l0l2and l1and showed that the defensive distillation method 32 used to prevent against adversarial attacks does not increase the robustness of the mldl techniques papernot et al 31 proposed a saliency map based attack where saliency map is used to find the most discriminative features of the input that are then fractionally perturbed to form an adversarial attack on the mldl based classifiers in 2017 papernot et al 30 proposed a blackbox attack where adversarial attack transferability 29 is exploited to form a successful evasion attack further details about adversarial attacks on different vision language and text processing systems can be found in 38 and 1 adversarial attacks have not yet been explored for cson we will cover some general networking applications in 2013 corona et al 9 highlighted the possibilities and open re search challenges of adversarial attacks on intrusion detection systems hu et al 16 proposed a generative adversarial network gan based blackbox attack on malware examples but training a gan on malware examples is difficult and computationally exhaustive grosse et al 13 proposed an adversarial perturbation attack against deep neural networks for malware classification where a restricted amount of feature perturbations are used to fool a deep neural network with 085 probability which was previously classifying malware with 97 accuracy in the next section we provide the details of the proposed approach to perform multiple adversarial attacks on cson iii m ethodology in this section we describe the approach followed in designing adversarial examples to evade the mldl based malware classification system which we use as a proxy for the functional areas of cson to the best of our knowledge no standardized deep learning based solution for malware classification in the cson has been proposed yet in this work we propose a deep neural network based solution for malware classification before delving deep into the details offig 1 depiction of malware executable as an image the proposed model we describe the threat model and few related assumptions a threat model in the following we outline the salient assumptions regard ing the adversarial threat the adversary may have the knowledge about the trained model which includes model architecture and hyper parameters but the adversary cannot make any changes to the architecture or model parameters this is a common assumption in the adversarial machine learning domain 1 the adversary can only perform attacks during the testing phase attacks on the training data ie poisoning attacks are not within the scope of this study for malware classification we assume that similar fam ilies of malware when represented as grayscale images exhibit similar visual and texture representations this hypothesis was proposed and defended in 28 in this work we utilize convolutional neural networks cnn for malware classification because cnn is by far the best feature extractors the goal of an attack is to compromise the integrity of the mldl based classification techniques through a reduction in the classification accuracy with small perturbations b malware image representation in this paper we have used grayscale malware image dataset provided in 28 where a malware executable is converted to a grayscale image this approach of conversion includes both static and dynamic code analysis the executable code is converted to binary and then represented as 8bit unsigned vectors these 8bit unsigned vectors are then reshaped to a 2d array which can be visualized as a grayscale image figure 1 is depicting the procedure of converting malware executable to a grayscale image c malware classification model we propose a cnn based malware classification architec ture table i depicts the proposed architecture cnn is a pow erful dl technique that learns spatial feature representations using convolutional filters cnn has the capability to tolerate the distortion and spatial shifts in the input data and extract features from raw input data cnn provides the stateoftheart solution for network traffic feature extraction and classification 24 motivated by these successes we explore the use of cnn for grayscale malware image classification in the proposed architecture we rescale the input grayscale images of various sizes to 28pixel wide and 28pixel highwhere pixel values are between 0to255 these input values are subjected to a twodimensional convolutional layer with 64filters of receptive field 14pixel wide and 14pixel high after that we use a rectified linear unit ie relu as an activation function the resultant activation values are then passed on to a second convolution layer with 128 filters and 55receptive field again we use a relu as an activation function similarly the third convolution layer follows the same procedure mentioned earlier but with 128 filters of 11receptive field after the third convolution layer the resultant activation values are flattened and passed on to a fully connected layer with softmax as an activation function producing resulting probabilities we use a variant of the stochastic gradient descent sgd as an optimization function and categorical crossentropy as a loss function to train the cnn table i proposed cnn architecture for malware classifica tion input

iterative method kurakin et al 20 proposed an elementwise basic iterative method bim for adversarial falsification it is an iterative procedure for generating adver sarial example for physical world applications they improved the success rate of the fgsm attack by including an iterative clipping method for each pixel to avoid large changes in the pixel valuesthe generated adversarial example is calculated via multiple iterations the adversarial example generation procedure is given as x0x 3 xn1clipxxnsignrxjxl 4 wherexn1is an adversarial example after n 1iterations the rest of the parameters are similar to the one utilized in the fgsm attack 3 jacobianbased saliency map attack papernot et al 31 proposed a new efficient method for generating adver sarial examples called the jacobianbased saliency map attack jsma this attack is an iterative method for generating a saliency map to find out the most discriminative features a small perturbation is added to these discriminative features to fool the classifier this attack is based on calculating the jacobian of the forward propagating examples with respect to the input sample the procedure of generating the saliency map of each sample is given as jx fx x fjx xi 5 this attack achieved 97 accuracy by altering only 42of the input features although this attack provides very effective adversarial examples",

generalization of the deep neural networks papernot et al 32 used the distillation process to form a defense against ad versarial examples network distillation is a process of training a classifier such that the generation of adversarial examples becomes very difficult this defense is based on hiding the gradients between presoftmax layers and the softmax output which reduces the chances of developing a gradientbased attack against deep neural networks since in this paper we consider whitebox attacks where an adversary knows the model parameters ie architecture hyperparameters gradi ents etc this defensive scheme is not applicable to our study more information on defence schemes against adversarial examples can be found in 38 v d iscussions challenges and future extensions our experimental results clearly demonstrate that applying mldl techniques in cson without taking into account adversarial perturbation threats can potentially lead to major security risks to date there does not exist any appropriate solution that provides deterrence against all kinds of adversar ial perturbations our experiments answer the questions posed earlier in section iv furthermore they provide the following insights robustness of mldl for cson in section ivb we have shown that cson are very vulnerable to adversarial attacks sparsity high dimensionality unstructured na ture unique data packing scheme large salient feature decision space of network data and less fault tolerance makes adversarial attacks more lethal for cson as compared to other vision and language data given the adversarial threat networking community has to come up with new mldl mechanism to ensure appropriate deterrence against adversarial examples robustness canbe introduced by incorporating approximation and fault tolerance on top of defense techniques against adversarial threats deterrence against adversarial attacks in cson we have performed proactive defense against adversarial at tacks by training on adversarial examples this adver sarial training procedure provides deterrence against the adversarial examples it is trained on but an unknown adversarial perturbation can evade the classifier table ii depicts that when the classifier is trained via an adversarial training procedure it enables the malware classifier to classify fgsm based adversarial examples correctly with 9743 accuracy after 100 epochs but the same classifier was unable to classify bim attacks with appropriate accuracy even after 100 epochs of ad versarial training this shows that before incorporating mldl techniques in support of cson applications like routing intrusion detection traffic classification malware detection the research community needs to figure out an appropriate defense against all adversarial perturbations the margin of error in adversarial examples classification is very narrow in networking application when compared to computer vision problems building deterrence against adversarial examples requires a method to improve generalization this can be achieved via constraint objective function optimization distributed denoising and exploiting vicinal risk minimization in stead of empirical losses apple inc 27 proposed a distributed denoising scheme for building deterrence against adversarial attacks for securitycritical applica tions whereas zhang et al 40 proposed a

race between adversaries our experiments also highlight that using mldl techniques in cson can lead to an arms race situation between adversaries conse quently adversarial attacks and defense mechanisms will be in an arms race where attackers keep on dynamically changing the adversarial perturbations and defenders have to adapt accordingly mldl techniques will enable future cson but before

16 argued that the adaptive data rate control used by the lorawan protocol is inefficient as it doesnt see the congestion in the lora networks to improve this shortcoming kim et al 16 used a linear regression model and showed better performance by reflecting congestion in the adaptive data rate control bor et al 17 proposed a lorasim simulator for experimenting with dense lora networks using different phylayer parameter settings they use fixed subsets of the phylayer parameter combinations to ensure colli sion avoidance the only problem with their technique is that it suffers from the problems associated with a rulebased mechanism ie their technique is based on a fixed system model and is not able to adapt to the environment changes which are normal in real networks slabicki et al 18 proposed an endtoend network simulator called flora for lora networks and also proposed and validated an adaptive data rate scheme for dynamic selection of link parameters for scaleable and efficient network operation they showed their technique to increase the network delivery ratio under stable chan nel conditions while keeping the energy consumption low they showed that the network delivery rate can be further improved using a networkaware approach wherein the link parameters are configured based on the global knowledge of the network they did not consider the collisions among packets which can significantly reduce the packet delivery ratio bianchi et al 19 presented a sequential water filling strategy for assigning spreading factors sfs to all lora nodes their design

improvement of 38 capacity over the adaptive data rate provided by lorawan abdelfadeel et al 20 propose free a finegrained scheduling scheme for reliable and energyefficient data collection in lorawan they propose that instead of transmitting the data as soon as it is generated it is scheduled for fixed time slots which are decided by their algorithm although this eliminates the problem of collisions in lorawan this scheduling solution is not scalable for dense networks as each ed will have to wait for its allocated time slot on the other hand our algorithm helps efficiently transmit the data as soon as it is generated at the ed with minimized collisions this also removes the delay caused by the scheduling scheme proposed by 20 which might be destructive in eds deployed for timecritical applications the lora network community has also utilized drl schemes for automating different tasks such as load bal ancing 21 and resource management 22 aihara et al 23 proposed a qlearning aided resource allocation and environment recognition scheme for lorawan withcsmaca they train different deep neural networks dnns for each lora ed which is resourceintensive our technique is only based on training a single dnn for the whole network also the learning of each of the dnn proposed by 23 is selfish and every dnn only focuses on its own reward while our technique focuses on a joint reward of the system also such schemes cannot be deployed in dense networks owing to the computational requirements techniques like 23 fail when they are tested against adversarial jamming attacks because of the inability to adapt to the changes in the environment farhad et al 24 propose a proactive mobilityaware resource assignment algorithm for lorawan they pro pose to update the values of sf and transmission power value on each uplink communication their algorithm is not based on learning and hence is bound to fail in real environments where the conditions are different from simulation aggarwal and nassipuri 25 propose to allocate dif ferent sf values to the eds present in a small range of the gateway this allocation leads to a better perfor mance of the network by increasing the overall pdr their algorithm requires to explicitly provide an sf allocation ratio for the eds as our algorithm discussed later is based on reinforcement learning it does this automatically and there is no need to explicitly provide an explicit sfallocation ratio an approach similar to 25 has also been proposed by 26 chinchilla et al 27 propose an algorithm for reduc ing the collisions in lora networks their algorithm works by dividing the wireless medium into resource blocks where each research block is based on one sf value and one channel frequency the objective of their algorithm was only to increase the capacity of the network and they did not consider the energy usage in their algorithm furthermore they do not consider the intersf collisions while our algorithm discussed later takes all of these things into consideration ta et al 28 proposed the use of rl for dynamic phylayer transmission parameters selection for lora based eds they pointed out

used the multiarmed ban dits technique to solve the collision issue we identify multiple issues with loramab and hence propose our centralized drlbased algorithm as a solution to these issues the identified issues with loramab are listed below 1 loramab is exponentially complex in terms of its computational complexity and hence not fea sible for dense lora networks the convergence time of the algorithm is high and is bound to increase with an increase in the count of eds 2 it does not account for the mobility of eds this makes it inapplicable in a network consisting of mobile eds such as healthcare smart vehiclesaging society and postemergency networks 3 the focus on optimizing power consumption is not done properly due to a missing specialized objec tive function eds have the option of choosing any of the available power levels without particularly focusing on saving power this random choice does not always lead to the optimal power level selection 4 the computations are being performed at the eds without considering the power limitations in the case of batterypowered eds 5 to reduce the complexity of the problem lora mab reduces the action space of individual eds based on their distance from the gateway in case the eds are mobile a change in their position makes the learning suboptimal we refer the reader to 29 and 30 for getting a comprehensive review of the several adaptive resource allocation schemes proposed for lorawan in our previous work 9 we showed that the perfor mance deteriorates in a loramab based system when eds are mobile in this paper we perform further ex periments with loradrl 9 and show the applicability of loradrl to real lora networks furthermore we test the performance of loradrl in case of largescale jamming attacks and show its adaptability to changes in the environment we also show the susceptibility of rulebased techniques against these attacks iii s ystem setup we have previously described the working of our ddqnbased adaptive phylayer parameter selection algorithm for dynamically deployed networks in 9 in this paper we further discuss the complexity and applicability aspects in detail in the following section one of the major problems seen in the previously proposed resource allocation techniques for lorawan is the missing support for real dynamic environments which keep on changing with time furthermore in the experiments section we show that loradrl can sense the performance drop due to frequency jamming and hence can shift the system to the less interfered channels and hence maintain the performance of the network we also show the ineffectiveness of the rulebased system lorasim against such attacks a problem statement lora provides multiple sf values for transmission which lead to different data rates the signals generated using different sf values are partially orthogonal to each other by compromising the data rate the concurrent transmissions can be increased by the use of different sf values and transmission channels the efficient selection of these parameters in dense networks can not only save energy but also increase the capacity of the networkb system model in our proposed scheme we consider a singlegateway lora network containing klora eds uniformly dis tributed over an area of a radius of 4500m with the gateway present in the center the eds can choose to transmit the data using different phylayer parameter combinations over multiple available transmission chan nels we do not limit the sf values for the eds and all the eds are free to use any of the sf values the gateway acts as the agent whose goal is to decide the phylayer parameters for each of the eds it is assumed that a new ed arrives at each timestep and is located at an arbitrary location the normalized count of each of the actions taken until the current step and the approximate distance of the newcoming lora ed is taken as the state of the environment the basic mapping of our algorithm on the workflow of drl has been given in fig 2 the agent takes a specific action choosing a phylayer parameters combi nation for the new lora ed at a timestep and receives a reward based on the achieved packet delivery ratio pdr and powerusage based on that chosen action fig 2 mapping of our problem setup on drl the gateway is considered the agent and the lora network represents the environment we use pdr and energy consumption as our per formance metrics the pdr is defined as the ratio of correctly delivered messages to transmitted messages over a period of time the achievable pdr depends on the position count and behavior of lora eds for experimental purposes we are assuming a lora network consisting of class c devices for training after training our model can be deployed with any class of the lora devices we use the gaussmarkov model for the mobility of the eds this model eliminates the sudden stops and sharp turns encountered in the random walk mobility model by allowing past velocities and directions to influence future velocities and directions our previous results 9 showed that when the mo bility was introduced in the loramab system 28 the performance started to degrade immediately due to nonadaptability and no support for mobile eds the learning in loradrl is performed on the gateway which is independent of the eds and hence can handle the mobility of eds as far as state calculation is concerned our states are based on the actions taken by the agent until the current step and the approximate distance of the ed from the gateway the former one can be easily calculated by populating a table while the latter can be approximated using the received power ofthe signals from the eds it is to be noted that the eds present near buildings will show less received power than in case of open space this will lead the algorithm to choose higher sf values for such devices which is a good choice the lora devices can support a power level as low as 2 db in case multiple power level choices are included in the actionspace the energy consumption can reduce considerably due to the high trainingconvergence time of loradrl we propose the training of loradrl to be performed in simulation and then the model be de ployed in real networks with the learning to be continued with a small learning rate this will help our proposed model adapt and fit itself to the real environment it is to be noted that we assume that the number of eds and packet arrival rate is known at the gateway it takes around 5 packet transmissions for the gateway to get a reliable estimate of pdr for mobile eds we assume that the current pdr is being averaged with the previous 4 transmissions pdr as we are not assuming very high velocities hence the time required to get a good estimate of pdr is acceptable iv p roposed scheme for adaptive phyl ayer parameter selection a reward function to assist in the learning process we have designed a specialized rewardcost function to optimize phylayer transmission parameters selection for lora eds by using this reward function the maximum reward is given to the optimal combination of phylayer parameters the reward function is given in the below equations equation 3 is the reward for optimizing the pdr of the network only equation 4 is the modified equivalent to include power optimization rt pdred airtimeed 3 rt pdred airtimeed powered4 where poweredpowermaxpowerchosen powermaxpowermin5 ed is the newcoming ed that has arrived in the previous timestep pdr is the package delivery ratio andairtimeedis the airtime of the specific ed in seconds are the relative constants used to assign appropriate weights to pdr airtimeed and powered these constants act as hyperparameters and can be chosen depending on the dynamics of the lora networkpower is the reward based on the power choice for the ed this part of the reward function is designed in such a way that if we have 3 available power levels 3 db 6 db and 12 db the reward is also defined in a distributed fashion in this way more reward say 4xwill be given to the agent if it chooses 3 db power lesser reward 3xwill be given if it chooses the 6 db power and the least reward xwill be given if it chooses the 12 db powerb proposed algorithm the proposed ddqnbased algorithm for learning the phylayer transmission parameters for eds in a lora network has been given in algorithm 1 qnetwork structure is taken as input to the model and it returns a trained ddqn network at the output the algorithm trains for a given number of episodes where each episode is run for timesteps equal to the maximum number of eds present in the system we assume that a new ed arrives at each timestep the replay buffer is populated by the agent by taking different actions at different states samples from this replay buffer are then used to train the neural network this trained network provides the optimal policy for determining the best phylayer parameters for the eds based on the state of the environment algorithm 1 loradrl input qnetwork structure output trained qnetwork 1initialize both the target online qnetworks 2initialize the memory replay buffer

lora eds are sleeping except when they need to transfer the data the transmissions are carried out on the base of the different transmission classes ie class a b c we propose that the lora ed send the packets to the gateway which in return either sends an acknowledgment to use the previous parameters or sends the new phylayer parameters combination to be used for carrying out further transmissions through the control packets using the fixed bandwidth channel of 125 khz in case the lora ed does not receive the parameters or acknowledgment from the gateway it either chooses the maximum available power and sf to transmit the signal or uses the last allocated phylayer parameters for the transmission this mechanism has also been shown in fig 3 our algorithm also works well on the reduced action space by allowing the agent to choose from a specific subset of actions this reduced subset can be made according to the datarate requirements of different applications by fixing a certain sf cr or transmission channel fig 3 proposed mechanism for implementing our proposed algorithm in real lora networks c drl specifications the neural network is kept small to make the solution more practical a discount factor of 07 has been used to ensure the dependence of the current action on future rewards furthermore we also use the greedy learning procedure to fully explore the statespace where action at timestep tis given as atmaxaqtsa with probability 1 random action with probability 6 we have chosen linear activation at the output layer so that we get a probability for each of the actions in this way if some of the eds can choose only a subset of actions then that ed can choose the action with the maximum probability from that subset of actions the target qnetwork is updated on regular intervals with the weights of the online network",

performance of loradrl the rulebased algorithm proposed by bor et al 17 and the decentralized algorithm loramab it is visible that the performance of loramab drops more with velocities while lorasim and loradrl can keep the performance at the same level the performance of loramab drops because of the slow learning process however our proposed phylayer parameters selection algorithm can support lora networks without any de pendence on mobility velocities fig 4 performance evaluation based on different mobility velocities comparison of pdr of lora networks under lorasim loramab and loradrl with a confidence interval of 95 it can be seen that mobility does not affect the performance of loradrl lorasim while the increase in velocity causes a deterioration in the performance of loramab b performance in multichannel scenarios as we know the spreading factors from sf7sf12 are partially orthogonal and transmissions with different sfs can be received on the same channel concurrently similarly the frequency channels are also orthogonal and the same sf can be received on different channels without any interchannel collisions current lora gate ways can receive transmissions from lora devices on 8 different channels simultaneously for this purpose multichannel transceivers are used in the lora gateway different frequencies do not interfere with each other hence the devices can choose from the available sfs without compromising on the pdr in our previous work we had taken the combination of sf and power as the action of the agent for converting into a multichannel scheme we add the channel fre quency to the action space hence increasing the action count according to the available frequencies for testing the performance of loradrl in dense deployments we consider an environment consisting of 1000 lora eds and a single gateway the available choices of frequency channels are set to 8 which is the maximum number of frequency channels a lora gateway can receive and

video of the president of gabon has resulted in a failed coup attempt other potential effects of the deepfake threat include danger to journalism and democratic norms because elections can be manipulated and democratic discourse may be disrupted by creating fake speeches of contending leaders 1 3 unfortunately most of the current research focuses on creating and improving deepfakes and there is a lack of focus on reliable deepfake detection as reported in 16 902 papers on generative adversarial networks gans were uploaded to the arxiv in 2018 but only 25 papers uploaded during the same time period related to the antiforgery related topics recent research shows that neural networks can be used for detecting fake content 1822 these methods however re quire a large amount of fake and real training data to accurately learn the data distributions of both classes the performance of these methods drops significantly on the unseen fake data sampled from a different distribution or generation process as the underlying network may overfit the training data and thereby lose its ability to generalize the model can be further trained to classify previously unseen data but it will require a large amount of data from the new distribution which may not always be available in such problems attackers and defenders are continuously improving their approaches and rolling out new attacks and defenses therefore it may be very difficult to collect a large amount of fake data for new manipulation techniques for such scenarios a fake content detector can detect fake content without even being explicitly trained on it in the current work we propose a twostream network for fake visual content detection the first stream called spatial stream detects the fake data employing rgb images while the second stream dubbed as frequency stream utilizes a combination of discrete fourier transform dft and wavelet transform wt for discriminating fake and real visual content the frequency stream exploits the fact that the distribution of the frequency spectrum of the fake visual data remains distinct from the distribution of the real data frequency spectrum this is illustrated in figure 1 which shows the dft magnitude spectrum for a sample of real and fake images it can be seen that frequency spectrum has patterns that are different from that of real images these differences are used to classify the fake versus real content since the information captured by the frequency stream is different fromarxiv210100676v1 cscv 3 jan 20212 fake real fig 1 dftmagnitude spectrum for fake and real images has discriminative features which can be exploited for improved fake detection performance the information captured by the spatial stream both these streams complement each other and fusing them together can provide better performance and generalization to unseen fake data detection to the best of our knowledge this is the first work that studies the fusion of crossmodal information fusion to improve fake content detection generalization the main contributions of this paper are summarized next 1 a novel twostream architecture for fake visual

using rgb images while the fs learns to discriminate between the distri butions of real and fake content in the frequency do main the coefficients of the stationary frequencies are captured using dft while the coefficients of spatially varying multiscale frequencies are captured using haar wavelet transform the spatial and frequency informa tion complement each other therefore fusion of both has improved fake visual content detection 2 the proposed twostream network comprising of a fre quency and a spatial domain stream has outperformed the stateoftheart fake detection methods with a sig

intelligence ai to algorithmically retrieve a per sons emotional state using knowledge from psychology linguistics signal processing and machine learning ml development of aer capabilities can have a transformative effect on society with wideranging implications due to the critical role emotions play in human lives ranging from perception learning and decisionmaking 1 2 3 aer is an umbrella term that encompasses various related terms such as affective computing affect recognition emotional ai or artificial emotional intelligence aei that have been proposed in the literature for automated recognition of human emotions 4 in this paper we use the term aer and focus on human target aer humantargeted aer starts with active or pas sive sensors eg a video camera microphone physiologi cal sensor that mainly captures contextual and behavioural data related to affective facial expressions speech signals body pose gestures gait or physiological signals it is im perative to utilise

particular we focus on presenting the ethical concerns related to aer systems and databases to highlight the prescriptions for future aer prosocial systems we note here the specificity or universality of human emotions has been a longstanding debate 13 the propo nents of the universality of emotions suggest that emotions can be recognised regardless of the different cultural back grounds while theoretical studies 14 15 on multicultural studies have suggested six basic universal emotions current aer systems do not perform well in multicultural settings the novelty and contributions of our paper are high lighted in table 1 where we compare this paper with the existing articles on aer the article by mohammad et al 10 enlists the ethical challenges for aer and suggests future directions but does not cover aer applications or the challenges related to bias adversarial attacks explain ability etc similarly other articles only focus on modality specific applications 9 or general challenges 7 without focusing on ethical issues in this paper we attempt to present aers promise perils and ethical concerns we also provide prescriptions for designing prosocial aer systems we hope this paper will guide navigating research and ethical implementation choices for anyone who wants to build or use aer for research or commercial purposes the rest of the paper is organised as follows the promise of aer is described in section 2 the various perils of aers are detailed in section 3 the major ethical concerns withaer are discussed in section 4 we elucidate a prospective path to a

quality of life and help achieve longterm goals 13 it can help save many lives by monitoring people and regulating their emotions through stressful times eg in pandemics or economic crises it also minimises counter productive behaviour such as suicidal tendencies and or antisocial behaviour in healthcare settings aer services play a pivotal role in shaping the healthcare functionality and

illnesses the importance of aer technology has also come to the fore amid the ongoing global economic and public health crisis during the covid19 pandemic 19 the pandemic situation impacts people physically mentally and econom ically aer systems can help to analyse and understand emotional responses during such crises affecting mental health studies 20 21 22 show that the negative emo tions among the population increase during the pandemic ie covid19 and people become optimistic over time by adapting to the pandemic in global crisis situations like covid19 aer systems can help measure crosscultural emotional trends to learn the correlation among populations despite the socioeconomic and cultural differences 21 22 education emotions are very crucial in the education systems due to their important role in the cognitive processes respon sible for assimilating and learning new information 23 unfortunately the current education system fails to track students emotions and hidden indicators of their internal feelings thus making it delicate to adapt and keep the communication channel intact it has been found that the identification and monitoring of the learners emotional state greatly facilitates the teacher in taking actions that significantly enhance the tutoring quality and execution and improve studentteacher interactions 24 therefore it is worthwhile to utilise smart systems that can model the relations between emotions cognition and action in the learning context 25 in this regard aer systems can beconsidered by schools to quantify student moods and en gagement in the classroom 26 aer could help to reinforce students attention motivation and selfregulation toward studies it could also help promote effective learning by increasing students interest 25 on the other hand aer systems can improve certain emotional qualities teachers must have to facilitate pedagogical approaches in education 23 safety emotions are directly linked to human problemsolving abilities 27 safety behaviours can be predicted from the individuals ability to manage and process emotions during a time of stress there is ample evidence that negative emotions such as anger fear and anxiety strongly affect hu man behaviour and occupational safety 28 for example emotions can impact workplace safety and health in the workplace the negative mood of a person can contaminate an entire team or group this may damage workplace safety and impair team performance if such behaviours are left unaddressed negative emotions can be a workplace hazard with visible effects on team safety aer systems can provide better solutions to monitor an individuals mood and emo tions in addition these systems can help find workers who might need help in transport aer systems can be utilised to improve the safety of drivers as well as anyone on the road driving occupies a large portion of our daily life and is often associated with the cognitive load that can trigger emotions like anger or stress which can badly impact human health and road safety 29 30 studies 31 32 show that in duced negative emotions like anger can decrease a drivers perceived safety and performance compared to neutral and fearful emotional states aer services are being utilised in automotive environment to monitor the drivers fatigue alertness attention and stress level to improve automotive and industrial safety by avoiding serious accidents 29 mass adoption of aer systems to monitor psychological and physiological parameters can significantly enhance the detection of dangerous situations 24 law enforcement and forensics aer systems are increasingly being used for law enforce ment and forensics where such systems have many pos sible applications in identifying threats of violence and terrorism and detecting lies and fraud 33 in a forensic investigation a lie can arise from denial evasion distortion outright fabrication and concealment by offenders to ap pear nonaccountable for their exertions 34 aer systems can help law enforcement agencies to detect deception or malingering by identifying reliable emotional clues in this way aer systems provide additional aid and insights to lawenforcement agencies while pursuing criminal investi gations 35 aer systems can also help detect and differen tiate between acted and genuine victims 34 25 advertising and retail in marketing one of the best ways to sell products is to engage the customers emotionally companies employ vast resources for affective marketing by maximising user4 engagement with ai they attempt to understand and appeal to the customers interests and emotions 36 in order to gauge a shoppers emotion aer systems use sensing devices installed in hightraffic locations including entrances aisles checkouts etc aer systems detect the emotional responses of individual shoppers which help retailers in making decisions on crucial factors including product pricing packaging branding or shelf placement in this way aer systems help retailers understand how consumers communicate both verbally and nonverbally which may help fuel customers buying decisions emotions highly impact individuals responses to re ceiving marketing messages therefore sending an emo tionally tailored message to the target audience increases the customers attention to the advertisement this helps companies to increase the products appeal and achieve a higher level of brand recall 37 indeed advertisements with emotional content have more potential to be remem bered than those conveying notification 38 26 emotional and social intelligence emotional and social intelligence involves understanding inside oneself observing and interpreting others for cogni tive and emotional empathy and responding constructively in a given situation there is great interest in politics to capture and influence the mood of the overall popula tion or community to understand patterns of emotional contagion 39 emotional and social intelligence can help leaders and decisionmakers pick up emotional cues from a population and handle highly challenging situations social networks are particularly utilised to understand population behaviours 40 27 monitoring and evaluation aer systems are being utilised to screen candidates in interviews 41 and to evaluate and monitor employees fatigue stress happiness and job performance 42 it is widely accepted that emotional intelligence directly influ ences an employees intellectual capital organisational re activity and retentively production employee appeal and ability to provide good customer service 43 aer sys tems can contribute to assess a candidates suitability for a job and measure important traits like dependability and cognitive abilities in particular embedded aer systems enabled through iot can provide finegrained analysis of emotions and sentiments 44 which can be used in various ways for monitoring and evaluations in the military and other defencerelated departments aer systems are par tially used to track how sets of people or countries feel about a government or other entities 10 28 gaming video

situation still ends unacceptably since he did not specify exactly what he did not want and unacceptable values were incorrectly inferred 91 various studies have shown that aer technology is prone to bias and can suffer from a lack of fairness accountability and transparency this has real consequences when such technology is used for critical decisions such as in judi cial systems for making judgements about sentencing 51 58 therefore aer technology requires a continued and concerted effort to address such issues because misreading an individuals emotions can cause severe consequences in specific scenarios 42 ethical concerns related to beneficence non maleficence ethical principles of beneficence do only good and non maleficence do no harm are closely related beneficence encourages the creation of ai services to promote the well being of humanity and the planet while nonmaleficence concerns the negative consequences of ai 92 these con cerns are also important in the designing and deployment of aer technology therefore aer services should avoid causing both foreseeable and unintentional harm this re quires a complete understanding of aer technology and its scientific limitations to manage the attendant risks the services should be designed to benefit human beings and increase their wellbeing to make aer prosocial designing a prosocial aer system requires mitigation of ethical concerns highlighted in the literature 78 with the unprecedented penetration of social media applications and the use of surveillance technologies the optin and opt out model of data sharing is long gone now most of the applications gather data irrespective of permissions and the written conditions that one agrees to upon usage are written in a language that is a challenge for the regular user it is problematic and many incidents of unethical use of the data are being reported in the literature unfortunately the idea of beneficence nonmaleficence is not considered as vital as it should have been in designing aer systems beneficence nonmaleficence principles are based on moral conscientiousness social good and trustworthiness of people companies and algorithms raquib et al 93 pro pose a virtuebased ethical design of ai systems although the debate is philosophical and many areas of the subject suffer from a lack of generality the topic of virtuebased ethical systems and the ethical quandaries raised are also pertinent to aer systems because aer systems are meant to learn from user behaviour and how that behaviour may be watched hugged and altered the

saturated the market under the guise of covid19 these tools are often aibased with face and emotion recognition algorithms used to monitor exam participants though these methods are intended to assure that the examination is conducted correctly they lack core ethical standards such as privacy transparency fairness and beneficence coghlan8 et al 94 examined and reported ethical challenges with aibased examination supervision tools arguing that the issues will not be resolved until ethical standards are not included in the basic design principles of aibased auto mated systems like facial recognition and aer similarly the reality of social robots is just around the horizon and numerous aerbased robots are presently being employed in a variety of social contexts and the number of these robots is rapidly increasing the ethical challenges raised by social robots originate from the fundamental debate about the uncertainty and responsibility of ai systems bosch et al 95 provide a brief description of the ethical risks involved in social robotics including how the concept of doing only good and not harm is required for social robots as well as various technological and social challenges associated with developing such ethics in robots 43 ethical concerns related to privacy aer services mostly use dl algorithms that are trained on masses of data to learn and perform decisionmaking ethical concerns related to privacy require protecting in dividuals data and preserving their privacy over the last two decades the rise of surveillance capitalism went largely unchallenged tech companies like google and facebook provide free online services and use personal data for mass surveillance over the internet such companies collect and scrutinise users online behaviours including searches purchases likes dislikes and more to predict modify and control users behaviours lanier has coined the term bum mer2 or behaviours of users modified and made into an empire for rent for the economic model followed by big tech corporations in the world of surveillance capitalism the design of aer systems depends heavily on face recognition technologies and it is advised in the literature that emotion recognition systems should be regularly up dated and audited 88 bowyer 96 discuss facial recogni tion systems security vs the privacy dilemma the right to privacy is a fundamental right guaranteed by practically ev ery countrys constitution many countries use facial recog nition systems and by extension aer systems for mass surveillance without the agreement or scrutiny of regulatory organisations which is a serious concern in the domain of technologys social effect bowyer 96 argues that utilising these recognition technologies violates the constitutionally guaranteed right to privacy aer systems not only employ facial recognition technologies but also infer the emotional state and other aspects of the face without consent which is an abuse of power and a blatant violation of the fun damental right to privacy the effectiveness of a security surveillance system is determined by the performance of the facial recognition system and a combination of the algorithms to measure the underlying emotional states and motives from just an image of the face and body these algorithms and facial recognition systems have shown to be biased and unreliable in the literature 97 false positives and negatives have lifethreatening repercussions and pri vacy infringement concerns are unprecedented 98 2 httpswwwtheguardiancomtechnology2018may27

internetofthings iot robotics pervasive technologies biometric technolo gies augmented and virtual reality and digital platforms 99 aer systems are used in homes health care facilities childcare centres social media apps and other digital plat forms for monitoring data collecting emotion inference and feedback translation because the data collected by aer systems is the property of the device

social group woensel et al 105 raised the problem of agency in aer systems and linked it to data gathering from people and social groupings without proper consent and agency the critical concern raised in the paper was the potential of using aer systems for targeted and mass surveillance which in any rational society is considered a violation of social standards privacy and ethics the paper recommended imposing strict con trols on data collection for aer systems or for prohibiting them until the necessary ethical standards are satisfied cavoukian et al 106 outlined seven rules for introducing privacy by design in systems we show these rules in figure 3 these rules can help improve privacy while providing a reasonable design path toward ethicscentred privacy for aer systems 10 fig 3 seven rules for introducing privacy by design in systems 106 44 ethical concerns related to autonomy when we adopt aer services in daily life we willingly cede some of our decisionmaking power to ai this may un dermine the flourishing of human autonomy with artificial autonomy therefore it is crucial to balance the decision making power delegated to aer agents and that we retain for ourselves aer systems must not impair the freedom of their users so they can live according to their standards and norms for ai to yield any benefits for the human race it must be focused on the autonomy of humans rather than the popular belief of giving more autonomy to machines 107 this argument stems from the classical discussions on whether ai techniques are tools to help improve life by making tasks easier or ai understanding the problems by itself and fixing them without categorically consenting the humans here it is essential to understand what autonomy means autonomy is described as the sense of willingness and a cognitive process of committing to a course of action calvo et al 108 take a closer look at human autonomy and technology under the pretext of ethics they highlight that in 2019 most of the literature around autonomy was focused on machine autonomy whereas now this trend is shifted towards human autonomybased technology design after critical technical and ethical issues with machine autonomy and design of machine autonomy were highlighted aer systems are designed to translate the stateoftheart in human psychology using ai and psycho graphs techniques unfortunately human autonomy and ethical questions such as willingness to interact and adopt are not appropriately addressed abbass 109 and 110 argue that since ai techniques are now being integrated into various aspectsof society it is paramount to prefer humans in the loop or humans on the loopbased algorithms for decision making it will ensure that human autonomy and ethical practices are followed in making critical decisions emotion recognition systems are trained on the data harvested from social media and digital platforms to un derstand and infer emotions andalibi et al 111 surveyed 13 social media users about the fact that the data from social media applications are used for training emotion recognition systems without getting users consent even if consent is taken it is collected through a terms and condition form which is mainly forced and in a legal language that is not userfriendly their results indicate that most of the participants viewed it as scary invasive unethical and a loss of power and human autonomy the paper further recommends that ethical usage be ensured in these critical applications at an individual and societal level gender bias is another ethical quandary in the aer system and using these tools in the field necessitates a gender bias evaluation in emotion recognition systems domnich et al 65 assessed the performance of several ai approaches and showed which kind of networks are employed for certain types of emotions the results of the experiments revealed that specific ai designs are discriminatory with significant differences in performance between males and females in terms of emotion recognition another vertical of this discussion on the autonomyrelated aer system is the categorisation of complex human emotions into a set of classes and then the offering solutionsinterventions based on these categories unfortunately this classification concept has a fundamental weakness since human emotions both as individuals and as social groupings are complicated private unique and occasionally indefinable and reducing these aspects to a data point and using it to tweak the behaviour raises various ethical issues 5 p ath to a prosocial future for aer as motivated in the previous sections aer systems are promising for contributing to social good in a wide variety of applications such as healthcare education safety and law enforcement but at the same time it is beset with several risks and perils which must be addressed qadir et al 112 have stressed the need for a more humane human centred ai that is accountable and have outlined promising directions for achieving accountable humancentred ai in this section we highlight some approaches we can adopt to pave the way for a prosocial future for aer systems 51 better awareness and education the development of aer software is bringing enormous changes to society through data analysis aer technology has the positive effect of revolutionising many areas by solving various existing problems on the other hand aer technologies are twosided which can also cause problems therefore it is crucial to raise awareness among the broader population about aers role in our lives and the use and purchase of aer services this can help to achieve large scale adoption of aer services among the general popula tion and minimise the risk of being negatively profiled by aer technology10 52 auditable aer the auditability of ai describes the possibility of evaluating models algorithms and datasets in terms of operation results and effects it has two parts including technical and ethical the technical part assesses the reliability and accuracy of results however the ethical part apprehends its individual and collective impacts and checks the risks of breaching certain principles including equality or privacy aer systems learn from the data they are exposed to and make decisions using ml algorithms they can develop or even amplify biases and discrimination therefore it is essential to audit and test aer algorithms throughout their life cycle to pinpoint the origin of errors and detect risks to avoid their impact on the lives of individuals and society it will help to systematically probe aer systems uncover biases and avoid undesirable behaviour 53 explainable and interpretable aer a key reason behind the fragility of aer services is the blackbox nature of ml models used for the decision making process these ml models are neither explainable nor their outcomes interpretable to realise the real potential of aer systems it is highly desirable to make them ex plainable in a humanunderstandable way in recent years significant research has been devoted to developing novel methods for explaining and interpreting ml models in the literature different explainable approaches can be broadly classified as whitebox and blackbox explanation methods the whitebox explanation method describes the model by identifying the most critical features that contributed to a specific prediction 113 another method for whitebox ex planation is to compute the predictions gradient concerning individual input samples to discover the predictions rele vant features whitebox explanation mainly provides the modelspecific explanation while the blackbox technique provides local explanations of a model for a prediction 114 explaining ml models and their decision is critical as it is the key enabling factor for building trust and ensuring fairness in decision making this is also important for aer applications where decisions directly impact human life 54 privacy preserving aer in aer services the privacy of the users data is a growing concern mainly when aer is performed on cloud plat forms aer companies gather a large amount of user data to perform emotion analysis the data gathered by these companies is kept forever and the user does mostly not have any or little control over it the images video and voice samples but also textual bits also contain sensitive background information such as faces gender language etc the leakage of this data can be used maliciously without the users consent by an eavesdropping adversary and may cause threatening consequences to peoples lives therefore it is crucial to utilise privacypreserving ai models in aer systems to protect users privacy the methods and tech niques for developing ai systems that ensure privacy falls under the umbrella of privacypreserving ai privacypreserving ai has four major pillars1training data privacy which can be ensured by differentially private stochastic gradient descent dpsgd and pate 115 and similar solutions 2input privacy which can be ensured via homomor phic encryption secure multiparty computation mpc and federated learning 3output privacy which

ethical privacy protective aer system an entity should embrace the fol lowing principles transparency an entity must describe its policies related to the duration it retains data how the data is used how the government might access the data and the necessary technical specifications to verify accountability full disclosure an entity must receive informed written and specific consent from individuals before enrolling her him or them in an aer database enrolment is the storage of personal data such as voice and face prints to perform emotion recognition or identification personal consent an entity must receive informed written consent from an individual before using the individuals data in a manner that was not men tioned in the existing consent when individuals consent to use an aer system for one purpose an entity must seek consent from that individual for us ing aer technology for another purpose however users should be free to withdraw their consent at11 any time an entity must not use the aer system to determine an individuals colour race religion gender age nationality or disability ethical data sharing individuals data should not be shared or sold without the informed written consent of the individual whose information is being shared or sold data ownership an individual must have the right to access correct and remove his or her data print security and privacy aer data must be kept secure and private by the entity maintaining the data simply defining principles is not sufficient these princi ples should be embedded into practice and operationalised an entity must maintain a system that measures compliance with these principles including an audit trail memorialising the collection use and sharing of information in an aer system the audit trail must include a record of the date location consent verification and provenance of emotional data it must also allow evaluation of the aer algorithm for accuracy this data may also be incorporated in a watermark to ease the ability to audit 6 c onclusions and recommendations this paper discussed the promises and perils of artificial intelligencebased automatic emotion recognition systems we believe aer technology has a wide range of real life applications however we aim to caution aer users and service providers about ethical concerns aer systems have biases that can lead to incorrect results just like any other artificial intelligence ai based intelligent systems we cannot fully rely on aer systems in making deci sions however help from them can be taken to improve the final decision we also must carefully consider aer systems fairness transparency accountability and ethics during their development and applications for this we proposed guidelines for designing future prosocial aer solutions we are summarising below the recommendations for designing such responsible aer systems full examination across various dimensions is re quired for the data used by aer systems expres sions of emotion are variable across different lan guages this variability must be taken into account while designing datasets systems and deployment of aer systems one needs to examine the choice of ai techniques across interpretability concerns privacy energy ef ficiency and data needs ai tends to perform well for individuals who are wellrepresented in the data but fails for others therefore it is crucial to explore inclusive methods to avoid spurious correlations that perpetuate sexism racism and stereotypes aer systems are often trained on static data how ever emotions perceptions and behaviour change over time it is important to incorporate adaptability in aer services for predictions on current data this may include drifting target learning approaches privacy is not only secrecy but also a personal choice applying aer to a mass gathering without personal consent is an invasion of privacy harmful to theindividual and dangerous to society therefore it is important to follow suited privacy principles such as the seven by cavoukian while designing aer systems it is crucial to realise ethical concerns related to privacy manipulation and bias while designing aer systems therefore anonymisation of information at various levels is required the use of aer for fully automated decisionmaking is unsuited aer systems may be utilised for assis tance in decisionmaking aer services should be transparent to all stakeholders these recommendations are primarily for the re searchers engineers educators and developers who build make use of or teach about aer technologies these guide lines will help engender trust with customers and also improve the profitable drive growth of aer technology with all these guidelines in mind we shall be ready to fully benefit and enjoy

meld contains utterances from the friends tv series 1 iemocap the interactive emotional dyadic motion capture iemocap database is a multimodal database that contains 12 hours of recorded data 43 the recordings were captured during dyadic interactions between five male and five female speakers the dyadic interactions enabled the speakers to converse in unrehearsed emotions as opposed to reading from a text the interactions are almost five minutes long and are segregated into smaller utterances based on sentences where each utterance is then assigned a label according to the emotion overall

multimodal emotional database recorded from 12actors performing dyadic inter actions 44 similar to iemocap 43 the utterances in mspimprov are grouped into six sessions and each session has recordings of one male and one female actor the sce narios were carefully designed to promote naturalness while maintaining control over lexical and emotional contents the emotional labels were collected through

configuration we get a total of 11353 utterances from the dataset b speech features for utterances across all datasets we use a consistent sampling rate of 16 khz for extracting the audio features we then convert the audio into mel spectrograms the mel spectrograms are computed with a shorttime fourier trans form of size 1024 a hop size of 256 and a window size of 1024 we specify a total of 80

spectrograms are normalised in the range of 11 c hyperparameters the vqv ae was trained using the following parameters we chose a batch size of 256 and trained for a total of 1000 epochs with a learning rate of 1e4 the convolution layers each had a stride and kernel size of 2 and 3 respectively a total of 8192 token embeddings were selected where each had a dimensionality of 512 with our particular configuration we got a total of 64 codes for each given utterance we pass these codes to chatgpt along with textual data for annotation based on these annotations we trained over the classifier our classifier consists of convolutional layers and a bidi rectional lstm blstmbased classification network to generate highlevel abstract feature representations we employ two cnn layers in line with previous studies 48 49 we utilise a larger kernel size for the first convolutional layer and a smaller kernel size for the second layer the cnn layers learn feature representations which are then passed to the blstm layer with 128 lstm units for contextual repre sentation learning following the blstm layer an attention layer is applied to aggregate the emotional content spread across different parts of the given utterance the resulting attentive features are then fed into a dense layer with 128 hidden units to extract emotionally discriminative features for a softmax layer the softmax layer employs the crossentropy loss function to calculate posterior class probabilities enabling the network to learn distinct features and perform accurate emotion classification in our experiments we utilise the adam optimiser with its default parameters the training of our models starts with a learning rate of 00001 and at the end of each epoch we assess the validation accuracy if the validation accuracy fails to improve for five consecutive epochs we decrease the learning rate by half and revert the model to the bestperforming previous epoch this process continues until the learning rate drops below 000001 as for the choice of nonlinear activation function we use the rectified linear unit relu due to its superior performance compared to leaky relu and hyperbolic tangent during the validation phase v e xperiments and results all experiments are conducted in a speakerindependent manner to ensure the generalisability of our findings specif ically we adopt an easily

unweighted average recall rate uar a widely accepted metric in the field that more accurately reflects the classification accuracy across multiple emotion categories when the data is in imbalance across these a within corpus experiments for the withincorpus experiments we select the iemo cap data and compare the results with the baseline uar achieved using actual true labels we trained the

wellknown above mentioned leave onespeakerout scheme 7 54 in the second and third experiments the classifier is trained in the same leaveone speakerout scheme however we annotated samples using chatgpt with our proposed approach we repeat the second and third experiments using text only and text plus audio context results are presented in figure 2 overall results on data annotated using few shots achieve improved results compared to the zeroshot scenario it is important to note fig 2 comparing the classification performance uar using training data annotated by chatgpt and original iemocap labels that the emotion classification performance using training data annotated with only text is poor compared to the baseline here baseline results represent when the classifier is trained using the original annotations of iemocap this observation underscores the insufficiency of textual information alone to provide the necessary context for accurate annotation by chatgpt consequently additional context becomes essential to enable chatgpt in effectively annotating the data as previ ously found for example happy and angry voice samples often have high energy and pitch compared to a sad and neutral voice 55 building upon this insight we incorporated the average energy and pitch values of a given utterance as additional contextual information for chatgpt during the reannotation6 process both in zeroshot and fewshot settings however the performance improvement was not considerable primarily due to the confounding factor of gender as female voices typically exhibit higher pitch and energy compared to male voices 56 to address this limitation we extended the experiment by providing gender labels to chatgpt resulting in improved classification accuracy as illustrated in 2 in addition to average energy pitch and gender information we further proposed the utilisation of audio patterns to provide enhanced audio context for annotation to achieve this we employed a vqv ae model to encode the given utterance into discrete representations these representations along with the textual and other feature inputs were employed in various experiments for annotation refer to

        "prompt": "d limitations in this section we highlight the potential limitations of our work and in general the limitations of llms for data an notation during our experiments we observed the following limitations we obtained promising results by augmenting the training data with samples annotated using chatgpt however this approach proved ineffective when applied to corpora such as librispeech 61 where the recordings lack emotional variations although we attempted to utilise librispeech data results are not shown here the results were not as promising as those achieved with meld chatgpt is known to be sensitive to prompt variability which can lead to ambiguous and erroneous results if even slight changes are made to the prompt content in order to address this issue we suggest conducting exper iments using different prompts to generate annotations as presented in section iiib the inclusion of more context in the prompts has been shown to improve the quality of results however for ser annotation prompts this can be particularly challenging due to the significant variability of human emotions within short time frames this limitation stems from llms reliance on training data chatgpt has not been trained particularly to annotate speech emotion data while the emergent nature of chat gpt has aided with annotation relying exclusively on chatgpt annotation is insufficient through our research we have found that incorporating chatgptbased annota tions alongside the training data leads to enhanced classi fication performance notably when utilising multishotchatgpt annotations instead of zeroshot annotations we observe a substantial performance improvement chatgpt offers a significant cost reduction in data an notation for instance in our experiments we were able to annotate iemocap data examples using chatgpt for approximately 30 usd which is significantly lower than human annotations cost however it is paramount to note that the accuracy of chatgptbased annotations is not as good as human annotations because chatgpt is not specifically trained for annotating speech emotion data as a result it is a tradeoff situation therefore it be comes a tradeoff between cost and accuracy striking the right balance is crucial when utilising chatgpt for data annotation to avoid potential inaccuracies in classification performance despite the mentioned limitations we have found chatgpt to be an invaluable tool for speechemotion data annotation we believe that its capabilities will continue to evolve cur rently generating annotations using chatgpt and incorporat ing them to augment humanannotated data has demonstrated improved performance in speech emotion classification this highlights the potential of chatgpt as a valuable asset in advancing research in this field vi c onclusions and outlook in this paper we conducted a comprehensive evaluation of chatgpts effectiveness in annotating speech emotion data to the best of our knowledge this study is the first of its kind to explore the capabilities of chatgpt in the domain of speech emotion recognition the results of our investigation have been encouraging and we have discovered promising outcomes below are the key findings of our study based on our findings we observed that textbased emo tional annotations do not generalise effectively to speech data to address this limitation we introduced a novel approach that harnesses the audio context in annotating speech data leveraging the capabilities of a large lan guage model by incorporating the audio context we successfully enhanced the performance of ser yielding improved results compared to the textbased approach we observed that the quality of annotations by chatgpt considerably improved when using a fewshot approach compared to a zeroshot one by incorporating a small number of annotated samples we were able to achieve improved results in our evaluation we introduced an effective technique to utilise large language models llms to augment the speech emotion recognition ser system with the annotated data by chatgpt the augmented system yielded improved re sults compared to the current stateoftheart ser systems that utilise conventional augmentation techniques in our future work we aim to expand our experimentation by applying our approach to new datasets and diverse contexts this will allow us to further validate the effectiveness and gen eralisability of our proposed technique additionally we plan to explore and compare the annotation abilities of different llms for speech emotion data enabling us to gain insights8 into their respective strengths and weaknesses we also intend to use llms in the training pipeline of the ser system references 1 t brown b mann n ryder m

sequential models for audio processing initial applications of deep learning in the field of audio processing primarily utilised versions of convolutional neu ral networks cnns 69 however the inability of these cnnbased methodologies to encapsulate the sequential essence of speech data was a substantial disadvantage this shortcoming led to the inception of sequencetosequence seq2seq architectures such as recurrent neural networks rnns 70 and long shortterm memory networks lstms 71 specifically engineered for handling sequential data rnns proved to be a suitable fit for sequential data given their ability to process extensive sequences incre mentally maintaining a constrained memory of preceding sequence components a recent trend in research merges the unique strengths of both cnns and rnns this involves using cnns to derive audio features which are then fed as input for rnn training however rnns are known to suffer from the challenges of vanishing or exploding gradients to combat this lstms implement a gating mechanism alongside memory cells to regulate the information flow and mitigate issues related to gradients 7475 there have been4 fig 2 architecture of standard transformer a fundamental building block of large ai models adapted from vaswani et al 72 and tay et al 73 it consists of encoder and decoder layers both equipped with stacked selfattention and feedforward components the encoder derives hidden states from an input token sequence and the decoder utilises these states alongside its own output token sequence to produce predictions various adaptations of lstms such as frequencylstm timefrequency lstms bidirectional lstms convlstms and stacked lstms each proposed to cater to specific speech processing tasks despite their potency seq2seq models have certain restrictions for instance they struggle to leverage parallel computing hardware efficiently and have difficulty in modelling longterm contexts due to their inherently sequential nature 22 transformers for audio processing transformers utilise selfattention mechanisms to capture temporal correlations from sequential data 72 this equips transformers with the ability to capture extensive temporal contexts while maintaining reduced computational complex ity transformers employ selfattention layers to effectively capture distant relationships within input sequences unlike traditional rnns which struggle with such interactions self attention also enables greater parallelisation compared to rnns allowing transformers to process speech sequences holistically without relying on past states vaswani et al 72 introduced two types of attention scaled dotproduct at tention and multihead attention",

generate and interact with human language and its underlying contexts in increasingly nuanced and sophisticated ways their remarkable ability to efficiently capture contextual dependencies and relationships withinsequences has been instrumental in the creation of llms with billions of parameters such as gpt3 this breakthrough in capturing contextual information has extended beyond text generation to various modalities like speech and audio giving rise to the emergence of large audio models that have transformed tasks such as speech recognition emotion detection and music generation we discuss the large audio model in the next subsection 23 overview of large language models investigations reveal that the act of scaling pretrained lan guage models plms either through enhancing the model size or expanding the data size typically yields superior model performance on subsequent tasks adhering to what is known as the scaling law 89 numerous investigations have probed the limits of performance by training increasingly larger plms such as the gpt3 model with 175 billion parameters and the palm model with 540 billion parameters while the majority of scaling endeavours primarily focus on model size preserving similar architectures and pretraining tasks these expanded plms exhibit distinct characteristics compared to their smaller counterparts such as bert with 330 million parameters and gpt2 with 15 billion parameters they exhibit unexpected proficiency referred to as emergent abilities in tackling a variety of intricate tasks for example gpt3 has demonstrated the ability to address fewshot tasks via incontext learning a feat that gpt2 struggles with hence the term large language models llms has been coined by the research community to describe these enlarged plms and these models have garnered increasing interest a notable example of an llm application is chatgpt which adapts the gpt series llms for dialogue showcasing excep tional conversational capabilities with humans a significant surge in arxiv papers pertaining to llms can be observed following the launch of chatgpt5 fig 3 overview of foundational audio models afoundational audio model

around the top 10 of testtakers in a simulated bar exam various other multimodal large language models are proposed by utilising multimodal information including visual audio and text these llms are considered a crucial step towards artificial general intelligence agi most importantly large audio models see figure 3 attract significant interest from the research community to build llms that have intrinsic cross modal conversational abilities and are capable of perceiving and generating audio or multimodal content we also show a brief timeline for large audio models in figure 4 in the next section we cover popular large audio models and a summary of these models is presented in table 2 24 popular large audio models in this section we provide a brief overview of popular large audio models 241 speechgpt zhang et al 91 proposed speechgpt a large language model that has intrinsic crossmodal conversational abilities that allow it to generate multimodal content the model is based on three significant elements a discrete unit extractor a large language modal and a unit vocoder they utilised hiddenunit bert hubert 92 as a discrete unit extractor for the transformation of continuous speech to discrete units the meta ai llama 93 model as llm and hifigan as a unit vocoder the low availability of publicly available speech data compelled them to construct the speechinstruct a speechtext crossmodal instructionfollowing dataset com prised of two parts crossmodal instructions and chainofmodality instruction the training process of this model is broken down into three steps modality adaptation pre training on unpaired speech data crossmodal instruction finetuning and chainofmodality instruction finetuning they employ an unlabelled speech corpus to train the llm in a nexttoken prediction task which empowers the large language model llm to effectively handle discrete units of modality in the crossmodal instruction finetuning they utilised the paired data to align speech and text subsequently they applied the parameterefficient lowrank adaptation lora technique 94 to perform finetuning consequently they found the model to perform various tasks with correct output on different instructions although this model has shown remarkable crossmodal instruction recognition and speech dialogue abilities it also has some limitations that can be listed as paralinguistic information sequential response generation and context length limitation 242 audiopalm rubenstein et al 95 introduce a multimodal generative model called audiopalm see figure 5 for speech and text capable of both understanding and generating speech the model is built upon the foundation of palm 96 and palm2 97 initially devised for textonly pretraining the models training encompasses three primary stages tokenisation of text and audio modification of pretrained text decoders and transformation of the models output into audio they adopt token extraction techniques from raw audio 9899 following token processing the tokens are fed into a transformer decoder which subsequently passes through an audio decoding process they employ autoregressive techniques as in audiolm 99 as well as nonautoregressive approaches similar to 100 to translate decoding tokens into audio their findings demonstrate6 fig 4 timeline of large audio models improved asrast performance with llm size and a single model is effectively trained across multiple tasks 243 audiolm borsos et al 99 present the audiolm framework designed to facilitate highquality audio synthesis while prioritising the preservation of longterm consistency coherence and uniformity across extended time spans this framework is composed of three integral components a tokeniser model a decoderonly transformer and a detokeniser model drawing from soundstream 101 w2vbert 102 the k means quantiser for w2vbert embeddings and decoder only transformers all of which have been trained on the extensive librilight 103 english dataset encompassing 60000 hours of speech data the authors assembled these components this amalgamation incorporates adversarial neural audio compression selfsupervised representation learning and language modelling techniques they have shown a comparison between the acoustic tokens from soundstream and the semantic tokens extracted from a pre trained w2vbert model on a speech dataset to show that these two types of tokens complement each other regarding enhancing phonetic discriminability and attaining high quality rebuilding of the audio content through training on comprehensive raw audio waveform datasets audiolm acquires the proficiency to generate highquality and logically coherent audio extensions from concise prompts converting input audio into a series of tokens audiolm approaches audio generation as a language modelling task 244 audiogen meta recently introduced audiocraft an extensive frame work designed to facilitate a diverse range of generative audio tasks encompassing music generation sound effects creation and posttraining compression using raw audio sig nals this comprehensive framework consists of three essen tial components musicgen 104 audiogen and encodec both musicgen and audiogen incorporate independent autoregressive language models lms tailored to operatewith discrete audio representations in the form of tokens in contrast encodec is built upon neural networks audiogen 104 a critical component of this framework is an autoregressive model that effectively addresses the challenge of generating audio while incorporating textual inputs this model adopts a transformerbased architecture functioning with discrete audio representations the oper ational mechanism of this model can be distilled into two primary steps firstly an autoencoding method 101105 is employed to comprehend the discrete representation of raw unprocessed audio subsequently these acquired repre sentations are employed to train the transformer language model the transformer decoder language model is extended from the gpt2like model imbuing the entire system with an encoderdecoder configuration empirical evaluations un derscore the models commendable performance across both objective and subjective evaluation metrics positioning it favourably in comparison to assessed baselines notably the proposed methodology excels in generating audio continua tions adeptly navigating both conditional and unconditional scenarios 245 audioldm and audioldm 2 audioldm 50 is a texttoaudio generation framework with an encoder built on a contrastive language audio pretrained clap model and the latent diffusion model ldm for sound generation with audio embedding as input and text embedding as conditions the clap model is pretrained with datasets including laionaudio630k audioset audiocaps and clotho with the clap encoder the training of the ldm does not require audiotext pairs any more which is substantially different from the previous method such as audiogen 104 and diffsound 106 as a result a large number of audio clips without the paired texts could be used to train the ldm model and this leads to a generation model capable of generating more diverse sounds with potentially better quality as compared with audiogen and diffsound in addition due to the operation in the latent space the training of audioldm is much more efficient7 fig 5 overview of the audiopalm model 95 designed for speechtospeech translation and automatic speech recognition a pretrained textonly model denoted by dashed lines is modified to incorporate an extended embedding matrix for new audio tokens the overall structure remains consistent accepting a combined sequence of text and audio tokens and decoding either type the subsequent stages of audiolm or soundstorm then revert audio tokens back to raw audio figure taken from 95 as compared with audiogen and diffsound and only one gpu is required for training on the audiocaps dataset in addition the audioldm model enables a number of other audiorelated tasks to be performed in zeroshot fashion such as textguided superresolution inpainting and style transfer built on the success of audioldm the authors have created a more advanced model called audioldm 2 107 which aims to develop a general audio representation method called language of audio loa for speech music and general sound effects with this method a single foundation model is learned with the same method and is able to generate highquality speech music and sound effects the self supervised learning method audiomae is used to convert any audio modality into the language of audio with the loa representation the audio signal can be generated with a selfsupervised learning process with a ldm with loa as conditions this technique leverages the strengths of in context learning the pretrained audiomae and ldm this method is shown to give stateoftheart performance in texttosound generation 246 ltu gong

diverse audio samples the training of ltu involves the creation of a novel dataset openaqa5m by amalgamating eight datasets containing audio questions and answers the architec ture of the ltu model draws from various components including an audio spectrogram transformer ast 109 as the audio encoder llama 93 as the large language model llm enhanced with vicuna 110 instructions low rank adapter 94 and specific generation settings to align the embedding dimensions with llama a pretrained audio spectrogram transformer is used alongside the cav mae 111 and finetuned on audioset2m 112 for audio encoding during training the authors maintained the llama unchanged to minimise catastrophic forgetting 113 they focused solely on training the ast audio encoder the audio projection layer and the lora adapters llama underwentselfsupervised pretraining on both natural language and programming language datasets while vicuna was fine tuned using instructions generated by gpt models the arbitrary initialisation of the audio projection layer led to training this component in conjunction with closedended classification and acoustic feature description tasks while keeping ast and lora adapters unaltered evaluation of ltu against a stateoftheart model clap showcased its significant performance in audiototext tasks achieving an average relative improvement of 231 across classification eight

audiocraft framework 117 is a texttomusic generation language model lm that oper ates on discrete audio representations to generate music8 from provided text descriptions this study introduces a model for generating coherent music based on text and melody conditions with extensive objective and subjective evaluations the architecture relies on an autoregressive transformerbased decoder 72 conditioned on textual and musical representations enodec 118 is employed to encode audio into a continuous tensor the model is trained on 20000 instances of licensed music data and evaluated against musiccaps benchmarks 119 surpassing evaluated baselines in subjective assessments 249 musiclm musiclm 119 has the main idea of generating music from the textual description and it can generate highquality music at 24 khz that has consistency over several minutes it leverages the multistage autoregressive modelling of audiolm 99 as the generative component and extends it to include text conditioning it also uses mulan 126 a joint musictext model to address the main challenge of paired data scarcity the authors created a new handcurated dataset musiccaps which contains the 55k examples prepared by expert musicians they trained the musiclm to generate long and coherent music for textual descriptions of significant complexity based on the results they showed that the musi clm can generate up to 5minute long clips and outperforms previous research in music quality as well as it adheres to the textual description musiclm inherits the limitations from mulan which makes the model misunderstand the negations which causes the model to not adhere to the temporal ordering described in the text 2410 wavjourney wavjourney see figure 7 is a method that uses llms to analyse text instructions and then connects a variety of audio models for compositional sound generation 127 first structured audio scripts are generated based on the text instruct using llms and these scripts are organised in terms of their spatiotemporal relations a script compiler is then used to convert the audio scripts into computer programs which then calls for various acoustic models and operation functions in order to synthesise the audio content this method offers a powerful creative tool for audio content generation for a number of potential applications including storytelling science fiction radio play and education 2411 seamlessm4t seamlessm4t 124 short for massively multilingual multimodal machine translation see figure 6 6 offers a comprehensive solution for a wide range of

an overview of these studies these large audio models such as speechx and audiogpt demonstrate their versatility and proficiency in handling diverse speechrelated tasks 4 c hallenges and outlook in this section we outline the potential challenges and future directions for large audio models or the use of textual llms to improve audiorelated tasks these challenges include the known shortcomings and unintended consequences of exporting llms to domains for which they are explic itly trained we also incorporate the challenges that have emerged from the attempts to design foundational models for audio processing it is important to note that these challenges are not exhaustive as research in this area is rapidly growing here we also want to note that llms have achieved remarkable results in language modelling and other discrete sequential tasks however directly applying llms to audio is challenging as audio is inherently analogue and continuous over time vector quantisation variational autoen coder vqvae helps address this issue by discretising the speech modality so it can be handled by llm architectures vqvae models the continuous timeseries input using a discrete latent codebook through vector quantisation this allows audio data like spectrograms to be reconstructed from codes while retaining most information about dynamicscoupling an llm with the discrete representations learned by vqvae provides a way for the llm to indirectly model the continuous nature of the input audio signal 248 exploring these challenges opens up exciting possibilities for advancing audiorelated tasks and pushing the boundaries of what llms can achieve in this domain 41 data issues llms or large audio models are trained on expansive datasets rendering the assessment and validation of the quantity and quality of data essential for pretraining llms in speech and audio processing a virtually insurmountable task the pragmatic difficulties tied to evaluating data quality give rise to a multitude of concerns encompassing issues such as duplicated data instances contamination bias and a diverse array of others 411 doppelganger data instances doppelganger data instances emerge as data that exhibit a resemblance yet lack complete identity they manifest in various forms including recurring words and sentences comparable speech characteristics similar structure and representation and more detecting these instances within a dataset presents a significant challenge as they can be nearly indistinguishable from authentic data entries the existence of these doppelgangers can significantly impact the performance of large audio models as theres a considerable chance that such models might memorise and subsequently reproduce them leading to diminished performance ad dressing this issue requires the compulsory removal of these doppelganger instances achieved through the elimination of repeated words and sentences coupled with the utilisation of diverse ml techniques for structural comparisons lee et19 al 250 introduced the neardup tool which effectively elim inates these doppelganger instances and repetitive substrings from datasets 412 data contamination data contamination as an issue is becoming an achilles heel of llms the impracticality of screening the data for pre training the llms makes it harder to ensure that evaluation data is

research areas for large audio models the leaderboard is a technique used to control inherited data contamination by providing details of the ancestor models and weights used for training a new llm model jacovi et al 251 proposed three strategies for mitigating data contamination issues in llms their first strategy involves encrypting test data with a public key and licensing it to control the distribution of derivatives of the test data the second strategy is conditioning the access of the api by demanding the api holders not to train on the test data lastly the third strategy involves releasing the contextual information of data sourced from the internet to circumvent data contamination arising from instances with online solutions such as repeated conversations questionanswer pairs emojis articles and their synthesised variations to the best of our knowledge the techniques that ensure robustness against determined contamination actors and prompts are limited in their performance

an attack on gpt2 and showed that the leakage of personal information increased nearly ten times which is an alarming issue a few more studies have also highlighted the leakage of personally identifiable information and despite the measures taken by various llm designing companies the issue still pertains and causes concerns recently there has been a surge in proposals for large audio

be pivotal in improving the overall performance of these models 43 computational cost and energy requirements pretraining a large audio model requires a massive amount of audio data and compute hours the compute hours need millions of us dollars worth of energy audiogpt with 137 billion parameters requires approximately 1 million kilowatt hours kwh which is approximately 137 million usd similarly the training cost of the stateoftheart audiopalm with 530 billion parameters is approximately 530 million usd while a few recent attempts have been made to reduce the computational cost and energy usage 93267269 the race to the state of the art in various audiorelated tasks is quickly pushing up the pretraining cost the amount of energy consumed in training these llms also hurts climate change and carbon emissions as the power needed to run the gpu and tpu clusters for pretraining 270 finetuning is another aspect of llms that requires considerable computing power although not as much as pretraining and usually a large amount of memory to store the model finetuning is a technique that adapts a pre trained model to a specific domain or task using a small dataset it is typically used for downstream applications and has proven useful for designing various speech and textbased applications finetuning llms for speech and audio processing can be limited by memory requirements the memory requirements of finetuning are the same as those of pretraining which can be a bottleneck fordownstream applications although there exist efficient fine tuning techniques like parameter efficient training prompt based efficient tuning and memory efficient tuning for text processing 94271273 comparable methods are limited for speech and audio processing 218274275 the need for specialised finetuning techniques tailored to the nuances of audio processing remains evident as the field advances addressing the memory challenges of finetuning will be pivotal to unlocking the full potential of large audio models for realworld applications 44 limited context length large audio models downstream applications require context understanding for making intelligent decisions this limits the quantity of data that the model may access when generating predictions it is especially difficult for tasks requiring longterm dependency understanding such as speech recognition 276 second the model may struggle to understand the links between distinct portions of a speech signal because of the short context length this can cause issues with activities like speaker identification and emotion recognition finally the models short context duration may make generalisation for fresh data difficult this is because the model was only trained on a tiny quantity of data making it difficult for it to understand how to cope with novel circumstances there are a few techniques in the literature for sorting out the challenges posed by the limited context these techniques are efficient attention mechanisms 277 280 length generalisation 178281284 and transformer alternatives 285288 an efficient attention mechanism helps decrease the context length while ensuring limited computational overhead on the transformer architecture length generalisation methods use positional embeddings to circumvent the limited context length issues and transformer alternatives can provide options for using techniques that do not run into issues context lengths as the field advances addressing the limitations of context understanding will be integral to unlocking the full potential of large audio models applications 45 understanding paralinguistic information paralinguistic information such as emotions plays a pivotal role in speech as they establish a connection with its inherent meaning and categorisation even identical utterances can acquire distinct meanings when expressed with different emotions 289 while llms excel in speech generation their capacity to comprehend and generate various emotions remains largely untapped and understudied zhang et al 91 highlighted the deficiency in understanding and generating paralinguistic information including emotions as a potential limitation of speechgpt similarly audiopalm 95 consid ered one of the finest llms for audio processing exhibits lim ited coverage in paralinguistic information comprehension although audiolm 99 claims to preserve speaker identi fication and prosody its exploration of emotions and other paralinguistic information remains unknown the llms discussed in section 24 all exhibit constrained exploration in generating and understanding paralinguistic information a compelling proposition materialises embedding the ability to generate and comprehend emotions stands as21 the next substantial stride in the evolution of large audio models by enriching these models with emotional depth they hold the potential to substantially enhance their capacity to communicate resonate and connect with human expression in various contexts moreover the field of music generation stands as another avenue poised for exploration within the purview of large music models just as with emotions in speech musics emotional intricacies are deeply intertwined with its tonal rhythmic and structural components large audio models that cannot only understand but also generate music with diverse emotional qualities could usher in a new era of creativity and emotional engagement in music produc tion and consumption the fusion of emotions and music generation could pave the way for even more comprehensive and impactful interactions with large audio models shaping the future of humanai collaboration in both spoken and musical aspects 46 prompt sensitivity prompts are the way to interact with llms they act as a query or input to the llm and in response to the query the llm generates the response it is now well known that a slight change in a prompt that is not perceptible to humans can disrupt the llms entire response this brittleness can cause serious consequences when llms are deployed in responsecritical applications such as healthcare 290 finance 291 and law 292large audio models engaged in speech processing tasks such as speaker identification speech classification and speech translation are equally vulnerable to prompt variations studies have begun to delve into comprehending the ramifications of prompt brittleness on generating labels for speechbased affective computing tasks 248 recent advancements including singleturn prompting incontext learning multiturn prompting and the chain of thought have gained prominence 293 however these techniques have primarily demonstrated their efficacy in textbased applications where furnishing context in plain language proves adequate intriguingly in the domain of large audio models a notable void exists despite the progress made to our knowledge the literature has yet to explore the design and testing of specialised prompts tailored specifically for speechbased scenarios addressing this gap presents an intriguing avenue for research one that could pave the way for enhanced interactions with large audio models 47 hallucination hallucination is a challenging issue in llms it is a behaviour where llms generate factually incorrect information that is difficult to detect due to the large number of outputs that llms generate 294 ji et al 88 divided hallucination into two categories intrinsic hallucinations and extrinsic hallucinations intrinsic hallucinations occur when llms misun derstand the source content and generate factually incorrect information extrinsic hallucinations occur when the llm generated output cannot be substantiated from the source data or contradicts itthe occurrence of hallucinations is not limited to text based llms large audio models are also susceptible this susceptibility can lead to misinterpretations of audio sources altered reasoning and the introduction of random noise to mitigate this issue the literature suggests several strategies including adversarial training diversification in training data human feedback incorporation contrastive learning and enhanced regularisation 88295298 it is notable however that discussions around the hallucination challenge within large audio models remain somewhat limited 108 given the growing prominence of models like au diopalm speechgpt and others in applications such as speaker recognition and speech translation addressing and comprehending the hallucination challenge in the context oflarge audio models holds considerable significance it is imperative to proactively tackle this issue to ensure the reliability and accuracy of these models in realworld applications 48 ethics aslarge audio models continue to gain prominence across diverse applications addressing their ethical challenges becomes a paramount concern these models are trained on extensive datasets sourced from the internet a practice that brings with it the risk of inheriting ingrained biases such biases can dangerously influence the output generated by these models inadvertently propagating content that reflects racism sexism or other forms of discrimination moreover these datasets might inadvertently encompass personally identifiable information potentially compromising individ ual privacy the intrinsic generative capabilities of large audio models introduce an additional layer of complexity allowing for the creation of convincing deep fakes that pose a significant security threat to downstream applications within this evolving landscape music generation with large audio models offers exciting prospects for increased creative engagement and novel artistic expression however it also carries the power to reshape musical culture and redefine economic dynamics 229 constructing a music generation system that involves user initiative like singing and preserves individual identity in the output holds promise for enhancing creative participation yet ethical concerns arise from the potential lack of user control over the genre and style of the generated instrumental output to address this refining the system to offer users explicit control over these attributes becomes essential mitigating the potential risks this intricate balance between creative empowerment and potential biases exemplifies the multifaceted ethical landscape that surrounds the utilisation of large audio models in music generation similarly the capabilities of large audio models to syn thesise highquality structured audio content hold immense potential across varied domains nevertheless they also inherit challenges similar to their textbased counterparts in cluding societal biases present in training data moreover the generated speech might not consistently align with intended accents or dialects for marginalised groups the potential for these models to continue short speech segments while preserving speaker identity and prosody raises concerns of potential misuse 99 demanding the implementation22 of responsible ai practices by delving into these nuances the discourse on ethical challenges associated with large audio models expands to encompass a wide spectrum of concerns underscoring the need for robust safeguards and strategic deployment strategies as the foundational research in this area grows the insights presented here along with related works can serve as a valuable guide to understand ing the complexities and addressing the challenges in the development of improved large audio models for audio applications 23 30 299 300 5 c onclusion in the rapidly evolving landscape of artificial intelligence the role of large ai models in particular llms in audio processing including domains such as speech and music is becoming increasingly pivotal this paper offers the first comprehensive survey on large audio models capturing the nuanced interplay of various llms within the audio sector by

machine learning ml big data network analytics and network telemetry to allow networks to configure manage and heal them selves the idea that networks should learn to drive themselves is gaining traction and there is a lot of interest in the networking com munity to develop selfdriving networks 10 the idea itself is not entirely new and reflects a recurring motif seen in various guises such as cognitive networking 48 selforganized networks 1 knowledge defined networks 33 and most recently datadriven networking 19 and selfdriving networks 10 28 the vision of selfdriving networks is promising and finds much encouragement from recent advances in ml such as deep learning and networking such as softwaredefined networks programmable data planes and edge computing however there are many chal lenges that remain most notably modern networks and their in tegration into the global internet yields a complex adaptive social system that encompasses the interaction of a vast diversity of au tonomous devices human users applications and service providers complex adaptive systems are characterized by their dynamic com plexity and nonlinearity due to which the act of playing the game has a way of changing the rules 15 any selfdriving network must acknowledge and address this complexity hence the real concern is not to only see the potential benefits of the approach to the optimizing entity itself but to also critically understand poten tial downsides and unintended consequences on other subsystems in this work we seek to investigate the pros and cons of selfdriving networks using systems thinking techniques 11 what is systems thinking although many different definitions of systems thinking have been proposed 3 all of them share an emphasis on interconnected ness and interdependency they focus on understanding how vari ous system entities influence each other and in turn themselves through feedback loops the goal is to facilitate users in seeing the proverbial forest for the trees 45 systems thinking is char acterized by three important features firstly the ability to think dynamically secondly to think causally through feedback loops thirdly to think more deeply about endogenous influences where the system itself is the cause of the observed problems 42 sys tems thinking is different from conventional thinking in many ways see table 1 but most prominently in modeling complex systems nonlinear closedlooped and multicausal with delayed feedback rather than linear openlooped causal with immediate feedback systems thinking has made a big impact in research on complex adaptive systems in such systems researchers have noted that 1 on analyzing selfdriving networks a systems thinking approach selfdn 2018 august 24 2018 budapest hungary table 1

the parts by optimizing relationships among the parts where to intervene aggressive use of obvious solutions careful change applied at the leverage points how to resolve problems cure the symptoms fix the systemic causes hardly anything is influenced linearly in just one direction and the presence of multiple intertwined nonlinear feedback loops have made social systems notorious for being counterintuitive 11 in terms of selfdriving networks this implies that it is not sufficient to optimize only a protocol an architecture or a network without reasoning about how this will influence the other parts technical as well as sociocultural aspects of the larger internet system systems thinking the right tool for understanding complex adaptive social systems since it is considered axiom in systems thinking that every influence is both a cause and an effect 4447 and that interactions between subsystems are modeled by circular loops rather than directed arrows we can define a system as an interconnected set of elements that is coherently organized in a way that achieves something a definition given by donella meadows a highly influential system thinker and the lead author of the bestselling limits to growth 32 the something in the definition may however be quite dif ferent from what the designer intended if we find some stubborn problems with a system that refuse to go away despite efforts and best intentions some authors call these wicked problems 6 it is likely that these problems are systemic ie the problems follow from how the system is built and from its architectural choices goals and constraints systems thinking opens us up to the fact that wicked problems may not be resolvable through further in terventions and that using more advanced technology is not always good or neutral 49 thus systems thinking may be defined as the ability to understand the systemic interconnections in such a way as to achieve a desired purpose 47 for more information about systems thinking we refer to various primers 2726 and books 47 6 on this topic 12 contributions of this paper in this paper we aim to highlight that the internet and selfdriving networks should be envisioned as complex adaptive systems in which we should be wary of easy solutions and quick fixes as pointed out by h l mencken theres always an easy solution to every problem that is neat plausible butwrong in a similar vein systems thinking research informs us that most wellintentioned solutions fail to sustainably solve their addressed problems and may actually create more problems than they solve however not all solutions are doomed in this mannersome highleverage solutions exist that can provide sustainable longrun benefits with minimum effort and these can be uncovered by systems thinking we propose the use of tools and insights from systems thinking in selfdriving networks for managing the unintended consequences of policies and for devising highleverage effective solutions to the best of our knowledge this is the first proposal to use systems thinking insights and tools for the study of selfdriving networks and possibly also for the internet2 why use systems thinking for selfdriving networks 21 leveraging a rich set of theory and tools systems thinking has been successfully used as a management tool to study policymaking in domains such as healthcare education management 46 and looks promising for selfdriving networks as well the field of systems science is a highlydeveloped discipline with many schools of thought including system dynamics com plexity theory general systems theory human system dynamics 34 47 31 we can leverage tools from a vast library of qualita tive as well as quantitative tools eg visualisations domain specific languages developed by the systems thinking community which has been active since its genesis at mit in the 1950s 44 26 as an example of a qualitative system thinking tool consider causal loop diagram cld which is an aid to visualize and easily communicate how different system entities connect to each other and influence each other possibly with a delay through reinforcing positive or balancing negative feedback loops this could be used to capture various aspects of decision making within modern networks for instance content delivery networks cdns exert significant influence on the traffic generated within isps by dynam ically setting the destinations of a large fraction of flows this has longterm impacts on isp decision making as well as transient ef fects on relevant content producers transit providers and exchange points it has been hypothesized that integrating the control loops of these parties could have significant mutual benefits 13 self driving networks offers a means to attain this but a vital precursor would be formalizing the influences and dependencies between these stakeholders clds offer a perfect tool in contrast to clds the stock and flow diagram is a quantitative system thinking tool for understanding systemic structure stocks or accumulators are things that accumulate and can be measured eg population bits transferred energy spent while flows or rates represents things that change over time eg transmission rate unlike clds stock and flow diagrams can provide informa tion about rates of change due to the lack of space we limit our discussion to these two tools only but highlight that the field has a number of other tools details of which can be seen in 26 47 22 support for rigorous big picture thinking systems thinking also affords us the ability to see the big picture by expanding our time andthought horizons using system thinking tools we can take better policy decisions regarding selfdriving networks and avoid an exclusive reliance on implicit mental mod els which are illsuited for this task since they are simplistic since they inadvertently substitute a higherorder nonlinear system for a 1in this paper we consider systems thinking to be synonymous with system dynamics 43 and to encompass it 6 although not everyone agrees 12 2selfdn 2018 august 24 2018 budapest hungary yaqoob et al linear causal one narrow ie not broad enough to see the big pic ture and myopic since they tend to discount the future and focus predominantly on the shortterm 11 systems thinking can also be used to better understand the connections between the various subsystems in particular it helps us identify nonobvious connec tions between effects and causes and also find missing connections which if they had existed would have improved the system perfor mance of our selfdriving networks 23 finding highleverage interventions in systems thinking systems respond to interventions according to theprinciple of leverage 47 previous research in system dynam ics has shown that most intuitively obvious policy interventions in complex social systems are lowleverage ie they do not pro duce significant longrun change and will likely also create other problems and only a few policy interventions are highleverage ie capable of producing substantial longrun change system dynamics research has consistently highlighted the counterintu itive nature of complex social systems in that the highleverage points are not where most people expect and if even these points are identified they are prone to be altered in the wrong direction by people 11 in an influential essay on leverage 31 donella meadows stated that interventions that rely only on parameter optimization are typically low leverage and higher leverage can be attained through deeper interventions that for example optimize information flows eg by minimizing information sharing delays or change the system rules ie the incentives and the constraints the most powerful way to change a system meadows notes is to change the system goals and paradigm out of which its goals rules and culture emerge although these ideas are abstract we can use insights about leverage points to unearth the few sensitive influ ence points in selfdriving networks thereby avoiding some of the problems that have plagued traditional networks 24 facilitating systemascause thinking in systems thinking it is considered an axiom that every influence is both a cause and an effectie it is possible that when a causes b b also causes a through a feedback loopin such doubly looped sys tem the systems are said to cause their own behavior endogenously we can use the systems thinking concept of systemasacause to explain how the perennial internet nuisances such as spam and lack of privacy security and qos are not isolated problems but as noted by keshav 25 follow endogenously as the byproducts of the internets design preferences this work points out that para doxically the internets architectural elements most responsible for its success are also responsible for its most vexing problems it is clear that if we want to fix these ancillary problems this cannot be achieved superficially without changing the systemic causes we can use this systemascause understanding in selfdriving networks to ensure that the purposes achieved by the selfdriving network are congruous to our stated goals 25 management of unintended consequences unintended consequences are the staple of complex social systems which follow unexpectedly from the nonlinear interactions between subsystems 11 and our propensity to intervene in systems with our solutions unfortunately our problemsolving instinct also creates a number of followup problems and networking systemsincluding future selfdriving networks are not immune to this tendency 40 systems thinking can help us anticipate and avoid the negative consequences of wellintentioned solutions this can be done both prospectively by anticipating unintended consequences during strategic planning or retrospectively by understanding more deeply the nonobvious causes of existing chronic complex social problems 3 system misbehavior archetypes system dynamics literature is rife with examples of fixes gone wrongin which wellintentioned commonsense interventions to mitigate a particular problem has gone on to aggravate it not to mention the creation of other problems 44 peter senge the author of the bestselling systems thinking book 44 devised a list of system laws generalized from manifestations of commonly observed system behavior in diverse settings and many of these laws are somber reminders of how systems can misbehave and how solutions can themselves create new problems some of senges laws most pertinent to our work are 1 todays problems come from yesterdays solutions 2behavior grows better before it grows worse ie benefits of quickfix interventions accrue in the shorttime only to neutralize and worsen off in the long run 3 the easy way out usually leads back in 4 the cure can be worse than the disease ie shortterm improvements can lead to longterm dependencies 5 cause and effect are not closely related in time and space and 6 small changes can produce big resultsbut",

consequences fixes that backfire are characterized by the use of a quick fix to reduce a problem symptom that works in the short run but at the cost of longterm consequences which people often fail to see due to long system delays this is a common pitfall in networks with some networking examples including 1 increasing queue buffers to decrease packet loss but instead causing bufferbloat 14 and 2 introducing additional links to an existing system only to see overall performance drop braess paradox 24 32 shifting the burden this archetype is associated with the concept of unintended de pendence this arises from dependence on a quick fix which is resorted to when the more fundamental solution is too expensive or too difficult to be implemented this archetype differs from fixes that backfire since the fundamental solution may not be ap parent or applicable in the latter with the shifting the burden 2due to the lack of space we omit explanations of these laws and refer interested readers to 44 3on analyzing selfdriving networks a systems thinking approach selfdn 2018 august 24 2018 budapest hungary table 2 system archetypes identified in system dynamics 44 with networking examples no archetype name description networking examples 1 fixes that backfire a quick solution with unexpected longterm consequences 23 25 14 24 ip nat 2 limits to growth improvement accelerates and then suddenly stalls ipv4 41 18 3 success to the successful things get better for winners and worse for losers 4 16 4 shifting the burden systems unconsciously favor shortterm addictive solutions 23 5 tragedy of the commons shared unmanaged resource collapses due to overconsumption 8 17 6 escalation different parties take actions to counter a perceived threat 35 7 7 eroding goals shortterm solutions lead to the deterioration of longterm goals 7 archetype the quick fix produces temporary relief by treating the symptoms which tends to reduce the motivation to implement the more fundamental solution the best example is seen in network capacity planning where operators would rather overdimension the network than implement more complex longterm solutions 33 limits to growth this archetype describes the concept of unanticipated constraints based on the insight that no physical system can sustain growth indefinitely any engine of growth however successful will in evitably be constrained by internal and external bottlenecks and constraints eg meadows 32 showed that we cannot sustainably support perpetual growth in a finite world this is a longstanding worry in communications networks for example researchers are now exploring how a permanent energy crisis scenarios may fun damentally limit our ability to maintain the currentday internet architecture and what our response should be in such an eventuality 41 39 34 success to the successful this archetype is associated with the concept of the winner takes it all it refers to the common tendency in social systems for the priv ileged to accumulate more of the benefits than the underprivileged this archetype commonly occurs in system dynamics and helps to make differences in privileges more pronounced over time for the purpose of selfdriving networks this archetype has implications for policy making for network neutrality and for ensuring fair re source allocation for example as major corporations eg google facebook control increasing portions of the internets content and infrastructure it seems likely that longterm competition might be crowded out this would potentially lead to an internet designed around the few rather than the many 35 eroding goals this archetype also called drifting goals is another easily recog nized system archetype it is a special case of shifting the burden where the preferred quick fix is to repeatedly lower the system goals this continuous adjustment then turns out to be fatal for the sys tem as it fails to fulfill its original design purpose in networks this sometimes happens in emerging markets where initial deployment expectations are curtailed by economic considerations 9 36 escalation this system archetype describes the story of unintended prolifer ation in a sort of an arms race in which the harder you push the harder the adversary pushes back many examples can be taken from network security where the attempts by applications to en crypt their traffic is responded to by adversaries upskilling their monitoring technologies eg fingerprinting encrypted webpages37 tragedy of the commons perhaps the most famous archetype this refers to the concept of a depleting shared resource that all parties are interested in exploit ing but none feel responsible for maintaining for networking this is applicable for unlicensed use of natural shared limited resources such as radio spectrumeg the problem of interference in un licensed wireless commons 30 it was also commonly reported in peertopeer file sharing applications where users would avoid sharing upload capacity 22 4 applying systems thinking in selfdriving networks in this section we begin to explore how systems thinking may be applied to selfdriving networks in particular we propose a system diagram or systemigram of selfdriving networks in section 41 and discuss various considerations for improving system structure in section 42 41 systemigram of selfdriving networks to illustrate how system thinking concepts may be applied in the context of selfdriving networks we use a systemigram a port manteau combining the two words system anddiagram shown in figure 1 the ultimate goal of systems thinking is to improve the understanding of systems predicting their behaviors and devising modifications in order to produce desired effects the journey towards this goal starts with understanding the system structure oval 1 in figure 1 which includes recognizing the interconnects between system components identifying the feedback between the various entities and identifying all the stake holders this understanding of the structure will help us understand the dynamic behaviors of the underlying system oval 2 the complex system dynamics can be modeled oval 3 using tools such as stock and flow diagrams and behavior over time graphs 26 the systems nonlinear behavior can be also understood by modeling the causeeffect relationship among the variables and fixed entities in the network system using tools such as causal loop diagrams system dynamics tool allow us to simulate system models which can be used to test out the efficiency of various policies or interventions oval 4 it is worth noting that selfdriving networks do not capture a single system but can be thought of as multiple interacting systems in which one system may be a subsystem of a larger system systems thinking is all about expanding horizons and seeing the big picture of how the system interacts with other systems which mutually influence each other therefore the next stage is emphasizing an understanding of the system at various scales oval 5 following these steps will improve our capability of identifying systems predicting their behaviors identifying relevant system

order to produce desired effects in selfdriving networks 42 improving system structure this section will briefly discuss certain key things that should be understood when designing selfdriving networks again we take inspiration from systems thinking in identifying these considera tions 421 tussles conflicts and dilemmas first it must be kept in mind that different stakeholders on the internet ecosystem have different often conflicting interests which when independently pursued create tussles of various types for example some people wish for privacy on the internet others prefer accountability and the ability to identify behaviors some protocols aim to implement a functionality in an endtoend manner others may prefer an innetwork mechanism the functionality implemented at various layers may be neutralized or may even conflict when designing a selfdriving network we must be clear on which conflicts are being managed within each design decision thus there is not a single happy family of people on the inter net with aligned goals 7 apart from tussles and conflicts internet protocols and applications also often face dilemmas in which the goals of the subsystem and the overall system conflict one of the major insights of systems thinking is that the best way to optimize a system is not to independently optimize each subsystem but to optimize the relationships among the parts which often is the bot tleneck an important implication for selfdriving networks is that we cannot be everything to everyoneit becomes important to clearly articulate our goals while keeping in view that different sub systems do not have homogeneous interests or pointsofview wecan also use systems thinking tools to anticipate the nonobvious interactions between the subsystems and use insights therefrom to minimize tussles and bottlenecks 422 on architecting goals for networks interventions that aim to optimize parameters are nowhere as powerful as interventions that aim at changing the systems goals and paradigms 31 to ensure better performance we need clearer articulation of what the goals of our selfdriving networks are we argue that these goals should be enshrined in formal declarative languages that are common across diverse stakeholders through these it becomes possible for systems engineers to reason over their design decisions for example it makes it possible to identify conflicting goals as well as key tradeoffs between them 423 focusing on system bottlenecks a systems performance is never the sum of the performance of its parts but the product of their interactions to improve system performance bottlenecks should be identified and efforts should be invested in alleviating these bottlenecks rather than on optimizing subsystems separately for example it is well known that control loops within content delivery networks and internet service providers can conflict eg redirection strategies within a content delivery network may nega tively impact the load balancing strategies of the network opti mizing these two subsystems separately is far less beneficial than improving their interactions 38 in addition to identifying the problematic connections ie bottlenecks selfdriving networks could also leverage systems thinking to determine new types of interactions that could mitigate bottlenecks through more efficient information sharing 13 doing so in an integrated way might address problems faced when deploying past collaborative mecha nisms eg alto 5 5on analyzing selfdriving networks a systems thinking approach selfdn 2018 august 24 2018 budapest hungary unfortunately these control loops can suffer from significant timing delays in most networks sharing of information is limited to standard protocol exchange eg bgp less conventional data sharing occurs within a period of days typically manually this means that relevant information may not be available to the de cision maker when required this is particularly problematic in selfdriving which may rely on secondbysecond updates to facil itate the required timely sharing of information new architectures and strategies such as split control architectures are needed 19 5 challenges in devising selfdriving networks the previous section has identified key opportunities and ap proaches to designing selfdriving networks finally we now look at key open questions and challenges that remain as ripe areas of research 51 finding the right functional split despite the moniker of selfdriving networks humans will not be removed completely from the management of networks there will inevitably be a functional split between humans and computers for network management it is true that algorithms can prevent many trivial manual mistakes but it is worth keeping in mind that algorithms are also not impervious to blunders 29 since algorithms do not have the common sense and can only learn from the given instructions or data with it being well known that human intuition is sometimes marvelous and sometimes flawed 21 an important and not entirely technical exercise is to map the boundary conditions for the management of selfdriving networks where we can safely relegate matters and operations to algorithms and where we will like to have human oversight eg in crafting policies related to matters pertaining to ethics and human subjects there will likely be many configurations of selfdriving networks and more debate is needed on the right functional splitespecially to avoid reliability security and ethics related problems 52 ethical challenges giving away the agency of decisionmaking to algorithms in self driving networks opens up a plethora of ethical challenges despite the many successes of machine learning ml experts have pointed out that many modern ml techniques work like a blackbox and may make predictions without really knowing why the harm ful effects of opaque unregulated mlbased algorithms described by oneil in 37 represent a significant concern for selfdriving networks in 10 an example of an mlbased spam filter was pro posed using features such as the autonomous system number of the sender although very useful one should reason ahead about the potential of false positives and take steps to ensure that we do not inadvertently create weapons of math destruction or strengthen existing stereotypes 37 50 we believe that systems thinking can help us perform higher order thinking and determine unintended consequences of relying on opaque ml algorithms and potentially biased datasets the question of agency ie who will take the ethical decision also looms large for selfdriving networks it is not clear if network operators and managers should make ethical decisions on behalf of the uses and if so then how these ethical questions may not have an objectively straightforward resolution and present dilemmaseg selfdriving network version of trolley problems 36 may arise in which the interest of many might be vying with the actions of a limited few and one has to decide how this conflict is to be addressed an example would be where a selfconfigured network chooses to block certain ip ranges to curtail a perceived dos attack whilst also impacting regular users the ethical decisions adopted may also have strong social and economic implications as the policy may be beneficial for some stakeholders but not for others furthermore changes in incentives may trigger changes in the services and products the clients will use we believe that systems thinking can allow us to rigorously study these ripple effects in selfdriving networks ethical concerns related to networking research are now being documented and guiding principles articulated 220 but specific ethical concerns around selfdriving networks require more deliberations 53 security challenges as remarked tellingly by russell ackoff",

vulnerable features after adversarial attacks together with the help of xai and aml can be identified and ulti mately any relevant defensive technique can be applied this interpretability becomes more

dnn models of son through internal and external attacks in the case of internal attacks adversaries can corrupt training data and classifiers of dnn models of son directly however these internal

complexities the performance of these visual systems experiences a significant decline when deployed in real world environments as opposed to controlled laboratory settings 132 133 consequently relying solely on facial expressions may prove inadequate in understanding the experienced emotion moreover identifying emotions conveyed through body lan guageposture presents a substantial hurdle this necessitates the use of costly wearable devices and advanced algorithms capable of discerning movements and subsequently translating them into the users emotions the need for multiple wearable devices to accurately capture the movements of various body parts may pose an inconvenience to users 134 additional constraints encompass device portability and resource lim itations such as

multitude of languages spoken globally 75 to rectify the limitations observed in vision body language and speechbased emotion recognition systems scholarly literature proposes the adoption of multimodal approaches 139 these approaches advocate for the simultaneous analysis of video and audio inputs harnessing the powerful synergy between facial displays and paralinguistic speech features by incorporating both modalities as shown in figure 8 a more resilient and accurate emotion recognition system can be achieved particularly when confronted with intricate or amalgamated emotions in

computing models this might encompass visualisations attribution methods or embeddings that shed light on how models capture and use emotions d ethical and social considerations in developing applications for eim eim holds the potential to reshape industries human inter actions and address global challenges while promoting equal opportunities however it also presents complex ethical and social considerations that necessitate careful navigation 105 183 as affective computing applications in eim gather and analyse user emotional data it is crucial to obtain informed consent and address ethical concerns 184 users must be empowered with control over the collection and use of their emotional data while simultaneously ensuring transparent communication of potential risks associated with emotional insights 109 185 since affective computing techniques for eim are still in their early stages of development it is crucial to address the ethical challenges before rolling out applications that rely on these technologies 185 14 volume this article has been accepted for publication in ieee open journal of the computer society this is the authors version which has not been fully edited

more information see httpscreativecommonsorglicensesbyncnd40oj logo the integration of real and virtual economies in eim brings forth risks encompassing security fraud scams and instability 186 it is equally important to contemplate the impact of eim on health and wellbeing as prolonged immersion in virtual realms can give rise to addiction or isolation 187 moreover the absence of moderation and the existence of illegal content only serves to amplify doubts regarding trustworthiness 188 the decentralised and occasionally unregulated nature of metaverse activities creates opportunities for misconduct and exploitation 186 188 the fundamental challenges hindering the realisation of eims full potential stem from the absence of ethical and social considerations within the broader technology landscape 189 as eim involves capturing human emotional states through various sensors the entrenched lack of ethical and socially conscious algorithm and product design presents a daunting challenge that demands immediate attention 189 190 rosenbergs research 191 delves deep into the metaverses potential risks shedding light on its potential as a potent tool for manipulation and persuasion the author uses the concept of feedback control and draws an intriguing analogy between the metaverse and engineering control systems as depicted in figure 10 in this intriguing context users effectively become subjects of control exposing themselves to an environment where their behaviours and emotions can be actively monitored and influenced in real time this scenario accentuates the urgent necessity to address the ethical implications of emotional manipulation within the eim the notable absence of explicit consent and transparency regarding data collection coupled with the potential for unethical practices by malicious actors raises valid concerns it is imperative to handle these concerns with utmost care and sensitivity to ensure that users maintain full agency and control over their emotional data 157 192 social norms could act to limit the development and implementation of affective computing applications in eim 193 for instance most societies have strong norms around privacy especially concerning sensitive personal data such as emotions 194 constantly monitoring users emotions could also be perceived as odd invasive or creepy by some going against social expectations of normal human interaction and potentially limiting adoption 195 196 certain contexts may also have clearer guidelines around the appropriate use of these technologies compared to others for example work education or healthcare versus leisure contexts 197 displays and interpretations of emotion also vary significantly between cultures so eim applications would need to be sensitive to cultural norms to avoid offence or misunderstanding 198 while ethical challenges in affective computing have received attention the specific ethical implications of ap plying affective computing in eim remain an underexplored area 75 199 200 a brief summary of challenges in developing eim are also provided in table 8 this entails respecting privacy mitigating perceived creepiness handling figure

realworld applications the performance of mlbased ser in crosslanguage sce narios faces limitations due to several factors a key factor is thelanguage and cultural barrier while human emotions are universal their expression differs based on ones language speech patterns and culture as a result the same emotion manifests with diverse cues and syntax across languages posing a challenge 7 8 another complication arises from culturalspecific linguistic nuances affecting emotional cues datasets used to train mlbased ser capture the nuances of a single languageculture while performance may

various audio tasks including automatic speech recognition asr texttospeech and music generation notably foundation models like wav2vec2 17 xlsr 52 whisper 19 mms 20 seamlessm4t 12 have started showing capabilities as universal translators for multiple speech tasks across up to 100 languages without taskspecific systems latif et al 15 also presented an analysis of stateoftheart methodologies regarding foundation large audio models their performance benchmarks and their applicability to realworld scenarios current limitations are also highlighted and insights are provided into potential future research directions for large audio models with the intent to spark discussion and foster innovation in nextgeneration audio processing systems careful analysis of biases is also needed as foundation models are deployed for realworld ser systems 11 while audio foundation models showabilities this research area remains in the early development stages further exploration and advancements are needed to fully realise the capabilities of these large language models for audio and speechrelated applications including potential pathways such as improving ser systems iii m odel architectures and datasets in this section we describe the foundation models and datasets used for finetuning we have selected various foun dation models for comparison to gauge their performance against the baseline cnnlstm model below we provide an overview of these models and datasets a baseline model our baseline model incorporates a convolutional encoder structure coupled with a bidirectional lstm blstm for classification tasks the convolutional layers within the en coder are designed to capture highlevel emotional features in line with past research 5355 we use a larger kernel size for the initial convolutional layer and subsequently a smaller kernel for the subsequent layers the encoders features are then passed to the blstm layer housing 128 lstm units to capture emotional contexts these outputs from blstm are fed into a dense layer consisting of 128 units generat ing discriminative features for the subsequent softmax layer overall the model is trained using the crossentropy loss for categorical ser b pretrained foundation models we employ a simple head architecture and build it on top of established foundational models among the chosen founda tion models for pretraining we opt for esteemed models such as wav2vec2 17 xlsr 52 whisper 19 and mms 20 these models gain recognition for their training on vast multi lingual datasets a comprehensive overview of these models focusing on their scale the datasets they train on and the range of languages encompassed in their training data is provided in table i we employ multilingual foundational models and fine tune them for crosslanguage ser by doing so we contrast their capabilities against a conventional cnnlstm baseline aiming to discern the effectiveness of these models in bridging the gap in crosslanguage emotion detection in speech wav2vec2 17 a selfsupervised model that learns by masking speech input in the latent space and tackling a contrastive task based on quantized latent representations it was pretrained using the librispeech ls960 dataset which lacks transcriptions and consists of 960 hours of audio additionally they incorporated speech data from libriv ox lv60k notably on the clear

robustness of pretrained models in this experiment we delve into the robustness of various architectures especially contrasting traditional models like cnnlstm with transformerbased models pretrained on vast and diverse datasets the test conditions involve the intro duction of ambient noisespecifically kitchen park station traffic and cafeteria sounds from the demand dataset 62 this noise is interspersed randomly within the test dataset performance assessments are then made on the data with a signaltonoise snr ratio of 10 db against clean speech and the findings are captured in figure 3 several observations emerge from this analysis pretrained foundation model given their extensive training on a large corpus of data seemingly display an innate ability to handle noisy disruptions better it is plausible that their expansive training data encompassed various noisy environments furnishing them with the capabil ity to better adapt to and process distorted auditory signals their ser performance in the context of noise tolerance distinctively eclipses that of the conventional cnnlstm model furthermore it becomes evident that sheer volume and diversity in training data play pivotal roles in noise resilience models like xlsr whiper and mms pretrained on sub stantial multilingual datasets illustrate superior performancemetrics compared to the wav2vec2 base this differential is not just attributable to the advanced transformer architecture but also the breadth of their training data specifically the wav2vec2 base model constrained by its training solely on english data struggles to match the versatility and adaptability of its more extensively trained counterparts this reaffirms the notion that diversity in trainingboth in terms of language and acoustic conditionsequips models with a more holistic noiseresistant capability v c onclusions and outlook in this paper we evaluated the performance of different foundation models for crosslanguage speech emotion recog nition based on our experiments and analysis we conclude the following foundation models like xlsr whisper and mms sig nificantly outperform traditional cnnlstm approaches for crosslanguage ser achieving higher uar scores across different language pairs this establishes the su periority of foundation models in handling crosslingual learning for emotion recognition as found previously 9 wav2vec2 when initialised randomly showed performance comparable to cnn lstm however models like xlsr whisper and mms which are pretrained on massive multilanguage datasets demonstrate improved performance in crosslanguage ser compared to wav2vec2 trained on singlelanguage data the distinct advantage underscores the significance of diverse pretraining datasets in elevating the capabili ties of speech models for finetuning tasks adapting the foundation models with a few target lan guage samples resulted in substantial gains over the base line demonstrating their ability to effectively leverage limited target data the foundation models also exhibited better robustness over cnnlstm when evaluated on noisy target data maintaining higher uar scores in conclusion while foundation models hold promise for crosslanguage tasks selfsupervised pretraining currently plays a vital complementary role in equipping them with the necessary skills for handling linguistic and

demonstrate the usage of the cellular communication signaling in the hybrid architecture remy et al in 30 exploit the usage of the centralized architecture of the ce llular communication to reduce the

information systems and internet access on the other hand the authors in 3234 propose clusterbasedhybrid architecture for message dissemination in this hybrid architecture the cluster memb ers cms communicate with the cluster head ch by using ieee 80211p and the chs communicate with the base station by using cellular technologies the goal is to minimize the number of chs communicating with the cellular network decreasing the number of clusters reduces the cost of using cellular infrastructure by lowering both the amount of communication with the base stationsand the frequency of handoff occurrences at the base station efficient clustering however should not only minimize the number of chs but maintain the stability of the clusterbased topology with minimum overhead as well none of

compare their performanceto that of ieee 80211pbased alternative routing mechanisms such as flooding and clusterbased routing in the literature v anet clustering has been performed with different purposes such as load balancing qualityofservice support and information dissemination in highdensity vehicular networks 38 stable clustering with a minimum num ber of chs and minimum overhead requires efficient cluster joining maintenance and merging mechanisms together withan efficient clustering metric considering the high mobility of vehicles clustering metrics used in the v anet literature include direction 8 1113 packet delay variation 10 lo cation difference 9 14 16 20 speed difference 18 and combination of location and sp eed differences 15 17 19 although a metric combining the location and speed of the neighboring vehicles is a better measure of their link dura tion compared with a metric considering their speed onlyall vehicles may not have localization capability calculating packet delay variation on the other hand requires very accu rate synchronization among the vehicles with lowlevel timestamping of the packets due to the random access protocol used by ieee 80211p moreover cluster joining in both onehop and multihop v anets is direct to the ch however joining the cluster through a cm and informing the ch later via periodic hello packets can decr ease clustering connection time and overhead significantly such efficient mechanisms have been proposed in mobile ad hoc networks which however usually assume stationarity of the nodes during clustering 39in addition cluster maintenance is achieved through either peri odic reclustering 810 12 16 17 where the clustering procedure is periodically executed or reactive clustering 14 15 18 where clustering is triggered only when the ch has lost connection to all its members or the cm cannot reach itscluster reactive clustering is m ore efficient since the reclus tering procedure is activated only when the cluster structure is destroyed without excessive periodic packet transmission overhead furthermore the previously proposed cluster merging mechanisms are activated either when the distance between two neighboring chs is less than a certain threshold 12 15 18 or when the chs remain connected for a time duration greater than a predetermined value 19 20 however clustermerging can result in verylargesize merged clusters where the ch becomes a bottleneck due to the high number of packets of its cms and a large number of hops which increases thedelay of packet transmissions to solve the clusterhead bot tleneck and largedelay problems cluster merging should limit both the size and the number of hops in the resulting merged cluster moreover the previous ly proposed multihop clustering algorithms only focus on providin g clustering stability through metrics such as ch duration cm duration and ch change but do not analyze the performance of their proposed algorithmin message dissemination in terms of metrics such as packet delivery ratio and delay see table iii in this paper we propose a hybrid architecture namely vmasclte combining ieee 80211pbased multihop clus tering and lte with the goal of achieving high data packetdelivery ratio dpdr and low delay while keeping the usage of the cellular infrastructure at a minimum level via minimizing the number of chs and maximizing clustering stability theoriginal contributions of this paper are listed as follows we propose a multihopclusterbased ieee 80211plte hybrid architecture for the first time in the literature the features of the multihop clustering algorithm used inthis hybrid architecture which is called vmasc are ch selection using the relative mobility metric calculated as the average relative speed with respect to the neighbor ing vehicles cluster connection with minimum overhead by introducing a direct connection to the neighbor thatis already a head or a member of a cluster instead of connecting to the ch in multiple hops disseminating cm information within periodi c hello packets reactive clustering to maintain the cluster structure without exces sive consumption of network resources and efficient size and hoplimited cluster merging mechanism based on the exchange of cluster information among chs combining all of these features in a multihopclusterbased hybridarchitecture using minimum overhead cluster connection and size and hoplimited cluster merging mechanism are unique characteristics of vmasc we perform an extensive analysis of the performance of the multihopclusterbased ieee 80211plte hybrid architecture over a wide range of performance metrics including dpdr delay control overhead and cluster ing stability in comparison to both previously proposedhybrid architectures and alternative routing mechanisms including flooding and clusterbased routing over a large scale highway using a realistic vehicle mobility model forthe first time in the literature we illustrate the tradeoff between the reliability of the application measured by the dpdr and the cost of the lte usage determined by the number of chs in the network for the first time in

different maximum numbers of hops whereas fig 6b shows the cdf of the cm duration of vmasc for different maximumnumbers of hops and different maximum vehicle velocities similar to the ch duration the average cm duration of vmasc is higher than that of nhop and mdmac under all conditionswhich again is mainly due to the efficient cluster maintenance mechanism as well as the lowove rhead and lowdelay cluster joining mechanism of vmasc t he cm duration increases as the maximum number of hops increases since collecting more information on surrounding vehicles at a higher number of hopsenables the

of maximum vehicle velocities for different maximum numbers of hops whereas fig 6c shows the cdf of the ch change rate of vmasc for different maximumnumbers of hops and different maximum vehicle velocities the ch change rate of vmasc is lower than that of nhop and mdmac in all cases which again proves the higher stability attained by vmasc vmasc reduces the ch change fig 7 clustering overhead of the clust ering algorithms for different maxi mum numbers of hops as a function of maximum vehicle velocities rate by leaving the ch state only when there is no member to serve whereas nhop and mdmac use periodic clustering maintenance which causes unn ecessary ch change in the net work moreover vmasc avoids unnecessary state transitionsfromch tocm by ensuring the connectivity of two clusters formerge timer before merging them furthermore similar to ch and member duration increasing the number of hops allowed in the clusters decreases the ch change rate and thus increases the stability of vmasc the cdf of thech change rate on the other hand shows that the variation around the average ch change rate of vmasc is again small demonstrating its stability 4 clustering overhead clustering overhead is defined as the ratio of the total number of clu stering related packets to the total number of packets generated in the v anet fig 7 shows the clustering overhead of the algorithms as a function of maximum vehicle velocities for different maximum numbers of hops the clustering overhead of vmasc is smaller than that of nhop and mdmac the first reason is2632 ieee transactions on vehicular technology vol 65 no 4 april 2016 fig 8 number of vehicles in the sestate for a onehop b twohop an d c threehop vmasc clustering better cluster stability of vmasc with higher cluster head and member duration another reason is the efficient mechanism for connection to the cluster through the neighboring cm instead of connecting to the ch in multiple hops the vmascalso eliminates the overhead of periodic active clustering by timerbased cluster mainten ance moreover as the maximum velocity of the vehicles increases the increase in the clustering overhead of nhop and mdmac is steeper than that of vmasc which illustrates the stability of vmasc in highly dynamicnetworks furthermore the clustering overhead of the protocols increases as the maximum number of hops increases since the hello packet s are rebroadcast over multiple hops to the neighbors within max hop 5 number of vehicles in the sestate fig 8 shows the number of vehicles in the sestate of vmasc as a function of simulation time for different maximum numbers of hops and different maximum vehicle v elocities the number of nodes in thesestate is larger at higher vehicle velocities when the maximum number of hops is small this is expected since the connections in the network break with higher probability asthe relative vehicle velocities increase the difference between the number of nodes in the sestate at higher and lower vehicle velocities and the variation in the number of nodes in the se state over time however decreases as the number of hops increases the reasons for this decrease are 1 the suitabilityof a larger set of neighboring vehicles at a higher maximum number of hops allowing better cluster selection for cms and 2 the suitability of a larger number of cms decreasing

stations direction of movement and intervehicular di stance and a periodiccluster updatebased maintenance mechanism with no any clustermerging the performance metrics are dpdr delay and the cost of using lte infrastructure 1 dpdr this metric is defined as the ratio of the number of vehicles successfully receiving data packets to the total number of vehicles within the target geographical area for the dissemination of the data packet the average is taken over all the data packets sent by the vehicles in the simulation fig 9 shows the dpdr of different algorithms at different maximum velocities for one two and threehopbased clus tering mechanisms the dpdr of vmasclte is above allthe other algorithms in all cases the reasons for the superior dpdr performance of vmasclte over the other hybrid architectures namely cmgmlte and mdmaclte are better clustering stability minimal clustering overhead and minimal overlap among clusters higher clustering stabilityresults in stable connections among cms and a smaller number of nodes in the se state minimal clustering overhead and minimal overlap among clusters on the other hand decreasethe mediumaccess contention thus increasing the success probability of the transmissions the reason for the superior performance of the clusteringbased hybrid architectures over pure clusteringbased data forwarding and pure flooding on the other hand is the efficiency of ltebased communication among clusters in hybrid architectures hybrid archi tecture decreases the number of transmissions in the ieee 80211pbased network by providing ltebased interclustercommunication which in turn decreases the mediumaccess contention moreover the dpdr of vmasclte does not considerably change when the m aximum velocity increasesucar et al multihopclusterbased ieee 80211p and lte hybrid arch itecture for v anet safety message dissemination 2633 fig 9 dpdr of data dissemination algorithms at different maximum velo cities for a onehop b twohop a nd c threehopbased clustering fig 10 dpdr of vmasc and vmasclte at different vehicle densities demonstrating the robustness of the clustering algorithm to the increasing dynamicity of the network furthermore the dpdr of vmasclte slightly improves as the maximum numberof hops increases which again is due to higher clustering stability as demonstrated in section va fig 10 shows the dpdr of vmasc and vmasclte at different vehicle densities the performance of pure cluster based dataforwarding mechanism vmasc is poor at low and high vehicle densities due to the disconnected network and broadcast storm problems respectively we observe that lte based hybrid architecture vmasclte improves the performance greatly providing a high dpdr that is stable at all vehicle traffic densities 2 delay the delay metric is defined as the average latency of the data packets that travel from their source to the vehicles within the target geographical area of dissemination the av erage is taken over both the packets and the destinations on the other hand the maximum delay metric is defined as the maximum latency of the data packets that travel from theirsource to the vehicles within the target geographical area of disseminationfigs 11 and 12 show the average and maximum delay of different algorithms at different maximum velocities for one two and threehopbased clustering mechanisms respectively when we consider these results together with fig 9 we observe that there is a tradeoff between dpdr and delay for flooding and pure clusterbased algorithms flooding provides lower delay than clusterbased algorithms whereas clusterbased algorithms achieve a higher dpdr than flooding lte based hybrid architectures on the other hand achieve both low delay and high dpdr at the cost of using the infrastructure among the hybrid architectures vmasclte achieves the lowest delay furthermore the dpdr and delay analysis atdifferent numbers of maximum hops allowed within clusters shows that increasing the maximum number of hops increases the dpdr at the cost of slight increase in the delay 3 lte cost the lte cost metric indicates the cost of using lte infrastructure to improve the data delivery performance of the hybrid architecture and is measured by the number of chs in the network the number of chs depends on both the number of hops used in the clustering algorithm and the constraint onthe maximum number of membe rs that ch and cm can admit which is denoted by member chandmember cm respectively we assume that the value of member ch varies from 1 to 10 however the value of member cmis kept constant at 1 in the simulation table vii shows the number of clusters ie number of chs for different member chand number of hops values as member chincreases the number of clusters in general decreases the number of clusters however may increase back when the number of hops and member chare high eg member ch10 at a twohop scenario due to the higher clustering overhead at the chs higher contention around chs and larger number of cms affect ed when a link within the clus ter breaks when both the number of hops and member ch are high in a cluster the number of vehicles connected or sending a request for connection to the ch is higher moreoverthe number of packets traveling to the ch is larger therefore2634 ieee transactions on vehicular technology vol 65 no

algorithms at different max imum velocities for a onehop b twohop and c threehopbased clu stering table vii number of clusters lte c ostofvmasclte for different member ch and number of hopsvalues there exists a lot of contention around the ch this results in the loss of packets around the ch and thus loss of connectionsto the parent node in the routing path to the ch when the connection of a vehicle to its parent node breaks the vehicle and all of its children transition back to the se state thus increasing the clustering overhead further and possibly creating an unnecessarily higher number of clusters fig 13 shows the dependence of the dpdr on member chfor different numbers of maximum allowedhops we observe that the dpdr increases up to 100 as member chdecreases the main reason for this behavior is the decrease in the clustering overhead and contentionin the ieee 80211pbased network with the decrease in member ch this demonstrates the adaptive usage of the vmasclte architecture depending on the reliability requirement of the application as the reliability requirement of the application increases the value of the member ch parameter needs to decrease at the cost of creating a larger number of clusters thus increasing the cost of lte usage vi c onclusion in this paper we have introduced a novel architecture vmasclte that integrates 3gpplte networks with ieee 80211pbased v anet networks in vmasclte vehicles are clustered in a multihopbased novel approach namedvmasc with the features of ch selection using the relative mobility metric calculated as the average relative speed withucar et al multihopclusterbased ieee 80211p and lte hybrid arch itecture for v anet safety message dissemination 2635 fig 13 dpdr of vmasclte for different member ch and number of hops values respect to the neighboring vehicles cluster connection with minimum overhead by introducing a direct connection to the neighbor that is already a head or a member of a cluster

connect the v anet to lte extensive simulations in ns3 with the vehicle mobility input from sumo demonstrate the superior performance ofvmasclte over both previously proposed hybrid architec tures and alternative routing mechanisms including flooding and clusterbased routing we observe that the dpdr performance of pure clusterbased dataforwarding mechanism is poor at low and high vehicle densities due to the disconnected network and broadcast storm problems respectively the lte based hybrid architecture however improves the performance greatly providing a high dpdr that is stable at all vehicle traffic densities moreover despite the tradeoff between dpdr and delay observed for flooding and pure clusterbased algorithms the proposed architecture has been demonstratedto achieve both low delay and high dpdr at the cost of using the lte infrastructure among the hybrid architectures vmasclte achieves the lowest delay and highest dpdr due to better clustering stability minimal clustering overhead and minimal overlap among clusters the dpdr and delay analysis at different numbers of maximum hops allowed within clusters shows that increasing the maximum number of hops up to three increases the dpdr at the cost of slight increase in the delay we have also defined the lte cost metric as the cost of using lte infrastructure to improve the data delivery performance of the hybrid architecture the lte cost is measured by the number of chs in the network we observe that the dpdr increases up to 100 as the number of members allowed in theclusters decreases the main reason for this behavior is the decrease in the clustering overhead and contention in the ieee80211pbased network with the decrease in the number of cms this demonstrates the adaptive usage of the vmasclte architecture depending on the reliability requirement of the application as the required reliability of the application in creases the number of cms needs to decrease at the cost ofcreating a larger

wireless data communication networks 1 legacy wireless communication network legacy networking architecture lacks the ability of cog nition they usually follow a strict rulebased policy in determining the allocation of spectrum resources identification of transmission channel interference temperature and many other network related information these rulebased systems initially work fine for a small set of users with limited quality of service qos requirements but as the wireless network grows in the number of users and their service requirements these strict rulebased systems with no cognition ability were not able to deliver the optimal performance the major reason for this failure lies in the ossification of the network design which did not allow the transmitter and receiver to learn from the dynamic environment and results in bad network performance poor qos and wastage of network resources2 2 crosslayer wireless networking communication systems were designed in a strict layered approach where each layer performed prespecified tasks and follows strict layering principals to perform these prespecified tasks the major shortcoming of this design was the lack of the operational information dissemination to other layers which is a major hindrance in fulfilling the necessary architectural design requirements of wireless communication system another reason for this failure was the timevarying nature of the wireless channel to overcome these issues a crosslayer designing approach for wireless network was used where joint optimization of networking protocols across different layers and improved coordination among different layers was introduced fundamentally crosslayer wireless network architectures are based on sharing the knowledge of physical and media access control mac layer of the wireless channel with the layers above them this information sharing solves the critical problem of resource allocation in wireless networking the major problem with this design approach is its lack of dynamic behavior adaption of the wireless network user diversity and different qos demands of users and this lack of adaption has a negative effect on the tradeoff between performance and interoperability 3 cognition based networking the rapid expansion of the wireless communication and the internet has resulted in a complex heterogeneous design which requires the network to be capable of dynamically adapting from the surroundings for intelligent resource allocation and interoperability the ossified legacy layered network design and the stringently bounded crosslayer architecture are not able to meet the diverse needs of the new era of wireless communication systems to meet these challenges the idea of cognition is taken from psychology and implemented in wireless communication network design this new paradigm was named as cognitive radios a spectrum access utilization before moving ahead with cognitive radios we need to mention another major issue which causes the diversion from crosslayer design to a more intelligent cognition based design this issue is known as spectrum access and utilization the electromagnetic spectrum is a scarce natural resource regulated by governments the expected exponential growth in connected devices and proposed small densely connected topologies for upcoming communication systems will have a disruptive effect on spectrum allocation and utilization similarly rapid growth in the adaption of new communication technologies and reduced cost of access for personal and corporate use has raised serious questions about the availability and utilization of electromagnetic spectrum federal communications commission fcc published a report in 2002 which is considered to be a very first document reviewing the 90 years of spectrum allocation and usage this report characterized the potential issues in electromagnetic spectrum allocation and usage 1 utilization of electromagnetic spectrum is biased in terms of occupancy of frequency bands in the spectrum when we sweep the whole frequency spectrum few frequency bands are vacant most of the time few are partially loaded and rest of them are heavily loaded this uneven distribution of frequency bands usage causes underutilization of the electromagnetic spectrum according to the fcc report underutilization of the electromagnetic spectrum will be the most significant problem in future communication systems underutilization of electromagnetic spectrum occurs due to two major causes namely traditional command and control procedures andfixed spectrum assignment policy this underutilization leads to a phenomenon known as spectrum holes a spectrum hole is caused when the primary user a primary user is the one which buys the license form the regulatory body and regulatory body assigns a frequency spectrum for a geographical area for a mutually decided time to which a certain frequency band is assigned for a certain time does not utilize it completely in 1999 mitola et al 2 proposed a solution to this fixed spectrum assignment policy by utilizing the spectrum holes for secondary users users with no spectrum license opportunistically this policy is known as dynamic spectrum access dsa opportunistic behavior involves sensing the surrounding environment and adapting to the statistical variations to extract the best possible result this sensing reasoning and adapting behavior is known as cognitive behavior by incorporating cognitive behavior mitola et al 3 in the year 2000 purposed a new paradigm of intelligent wireless communication systems called cognitive radios which has the ability of sensing the statistical changes in incoming radio frequency signals and making corresponding changes in certain network operating parameters this reasoning and adaptive behaviour3 has two primary objectives highly reliable communication whenever and whereever needed andefficient utilization of frequency spectrum cognitive radios introduced a sensing and reconfiguring approach in networking but this design approach has some serious issues like detection of weak signals from primary users before sharing the spectrum with the secondary user it required a tighter control over the secondary user to avoid interference and this control has killed the whole idea of opportunistic networking to solve this issue a new intelligent sensing algorithm along with customized transceiver was required another major challenge is to manage the tradeoff between the censored radius of the primary user and interference power to avoid the shadowing similarly dynamic nature of wireless channel and diverse qos demands needed a revised rate and capacity adaption algorithms for cognitive radios to work cognitive radios proved to be a much better design than previous crosslayer or legacy wireless designs but due to aforementioned flaws in cognitive radios design it was not very successful but it paved a path towards intelligent wireless networking b design challenges for next generation of wireless data communication networks now lets take a look on the issues in current wireless and data network designs heterogeneity com plexity and dynamic nature are the three fundamental properties of next communication generation the communication architecture and the internet were not designed to fulfill these properties with the emergence of new technologies such as the internet of things multicore architectures and exponential social adaption of these new technologies have rapidly increased the complexity of the wireless communication systems this has also increased the qos bar for the applications to meet the qoe of the users with all these new technologies wireless communication and the internet have become a bounded closed loop system with multiple tradeoffs and restriction to avoid multiple performance issues but now these strict policies have become a bottleneck in designing nextgeneration communication systems 1 network management as mentioned earlier there is an exponential increase in new innovative ap plications of the internet and wireless communication technologies but we are lagging behind in network management and this is very alarming given the expected number of connected devices and their diverse nature network management has lagged behind in innovation curve because of fundamental strict bounded internet and wireless communication system design to meet the challenges of nextgeneration communi cation systems and connectivity requirements we need to think a new selforganized network management systems 2 field of view of protocols wireless networks and the internet employs multiple protocols to make communication between transmitter and receiver possible these protocols are limited in their field of view and information sharing abilities with the complete network whenever we need to integrate a new system we introduce a protocol in the software and then keep on updating the protocols to fix the raised issues due to variable network conditions users qoe and security reasons although we employee all these fixes still we are lagging behind in user qoe applications qos security etc this is because the problem does not lie in protocols it lies in the protocols limited field of view and their inability to model holistic network systems due to shortcomings the operators are not able to have a complete picture of what is happening in the network this causes multiple technical issues at the operator which also reflects on consumers qoe although network function virtualization softwaredefined networking and centralized control have offered a solution of the protocol problem but apple does not the apple doesnt fall far from the tree these schemes have their shortcomings and these shortcomings have their basis in rule based switching of sdn and closed form of networking so in order to design nextgeneration networks we need to increase the field of view of a network protocol and rethink the restriction on the coordination among the networking protocols 3 measurement quantification measurement and quantification process of the wireless communi cation systems and the internet is of critical importance it is used for network planning and resource allocation this process is usually decoupled from network control and performed offline and this is a major shortcoming in current network design since most of the next generation networks are considered4 to be selforganized they need measurement and quantification process to be realtime and distributed to get a better view of network statistics to make an intelligent decision 4 knowledge base current wireless communication and data network architectures mostly use rule based or threshold based decisionmaking strategies for their operation automation recommendation and troubleshooting process very few applications such as sdn employees artificial intelligence ai for decision making when we consider designing a nextgeneration communication network this lack of adaption of intelligent machine learning techniques in current wireless and data communication networks is a very alarming problem the adaption of ai in networking along with centralized control and strong network analytics forms a knowledge base and provides the ability of realtime inference which is a fundamental property of selfdriven future networks 5 tussles current networking architecture has a distinctive perhop behavior for example routing there are many parties involved in how to perhop behavior should look like these parties have their own agenda or function that they need to fulfill these agenda can be aligned to the network overall function or these agenda have an adverse nature to optimize the network behavior to its own advantage without caring much about the overall system this property is termed as tussle 4 tussles have its basis in different social political conflicting interests biased users preferences internet service providers isp monopoly topological conflicts competitive nature of the current networking business etc these tussles will act as key enablers for rethinking the current networking architecture to support the future networking business 6 operators wishes the service provider or operator in current wireless and data network architecture is responsible for all the network planning decision making configuration operation maintenance and measurement quantification given the number of tasks and the expected number of connected devices in near future this becomes a design flaw we can leverage the advancement of machine learning formal methods programming languages big data genetic algorithms approximate computing and approximate networking to offload the operator by introducing a sensing collecting adapting and reconfiguring property in the network devices and the end users 7 routing routing is a core part of any communication network which provides the information flow in inter and intraautonomous networks these routing and forwarding algorithms are built on a strict non adaptive policy which causes inefficient resource utilization routing and most of the network components follow strict rules this is because communication and data networks were not initially thought of as dynamic systems future communication networks are considered to be heterogeneous complex and dynamic so to meet the requirements of the future networks a new selfaware and organized routing policy is needed 8 security another aspect of current networks which will be a major concern in designing the future network design is security the security in wireless and data networks is ensured by using hardware firewalls encryption techniques and thirdparty inclusion the major goal of security in the current design is to make the best security possible to avoid any breach but best security is not the perfect security best security solutions which include a combination of encryption and anonymization makes operators job of network management more tedious we need to revisit the tradeoff between security and network management cognitionbased solution by developing an intelligent model using the big data produced by the network can form a sustainable security solution which not only satisfies the privacy concerns of the consumers but also makes network security management possible 9 optimization premature optimization is the root of all evil donald knuth in current network architecture network administrator or network controller in case of sdn performs networking parameters optimization operation to meet the diverse user demands and dynamic channel conditions current networking architecture has a complex multi feedback loop alike architecture and this property limits the field of view of the administrator or controller and results in premature optimization this kind of optimization causes a disruptive effect on overall networking architecture5 10 signalling overhead a very imminent threat for the next generation of communication networks is the signaling overhead this is a concern due to a large number of connected communication devices forming a heterogeneous architecture to overcome this threat a new alternative intelligent signaling design is required for future networks 11connectivity",

        "prompt": "vs data rate in upcoming years embedded devices will cost less than one dollar and the number of connected devices will increase exponentially this will cause a unique problem where instead data rate connectivity will become a major problem future networking architectures must be able to deal with this issue intelligently by making a smart connectivity policy 12compromises tradeoffs the current wireless and data communication network design is a combi nation of many tradeoffs restrictions and bounds which is a problem when it comes to building a dynamic network architecture these compromises are made to enforce a strict policy to ensure better resource allocation improved resource utilization optimal network performance and security the outcome of these compromises is not as they were expected instead of producing optimal results in terms of avoiding breakdowns security breaches information loss interference and congestion these strict rules has proven to be shortcomings in designing a dynamic future networking architecture hardware and protocol design tradeoff latency throughput tradeoff the transmission rate restriction the minimum and maximum frame size bound in tcpip stack etc are the few examples of the compromises that need to be revisited and improved for building an intelligent selfdriven network c social economic challenges two fundamental driving forces that had played an important role in the success of wireless and data networks are social needs and economic growth these enablers are expected to be important components of future networks since the social and economic aspect of current networking architecture are key enablers they are also considered as major challenges for future networks we will discuss these two daunting challenges in upcoming paragraphs 1 social challenges networking is not about connecting devices that share information it is about connecting people the internet and other communication networks were designed on the basic principle of sharing knowledge and meeting the social needs of the society as society evolves the networking has tried to adapt accordingly by introducing different ideas such as congestion controls to dedicated systems password protection to encrypted machines spam filtering to firewalls open network to regulated network etc given the social evolution these aforementioned ideas may not work for future networks for designing new networking architectures the research community has to look into these five funda mental social aspects i do we need to revisit the social human contract which talks about the political and moral evolution of the human with time ii do we need to provide cyber education to the community iii do we need to conduct social studies to learn about the communication demands and risks before developing new designs iv how to convince the community to utilize the network for economic activity v how to settle on a less strict tradeoff on censorship and privacy for keeping the idea of openness of internet alive 2 economic challenges the relationship between alternative networking architectures and economic viability is a very critical problem that has been ignored for too long in networking research the infrastruc ture cost is decaying so does the communication cost how to build an economically viable new networking architecture economic problem will act as the most important problem and overshadows all the issues given in ib 56 there are ten fundamental questions that needs to be answered before designing the new networking architecture i how to build an architecture that routes money packets are side effects ii how to deal with the fundamental tussle between isp and regulator to get to a solution of how to utilize the infrastructure iii how to achieve the optimal longevity by keeping the economic growth iv infrastructure should be owned by public sector or private v what are the

between network cost and computing cost d rethinking the networking architecture given the problems associated with evolution of networking architectures and all the design flaws in current networking architecture along with social and economic issues current networking architecture will not be able to support the diverse needs of upcoming communication systems we need to rethink the networking architecture which has the following properties fit to its purpose secure resilient economically viable manageable intelligent self organizing and meet the needs of society design evolution flaws given in ia and issues in the current networking techniques provided in ib invites us to rethink the networking architecture in this paper we will try to provide an alternative design approach for

        "prompt": "initial security design assumption were flawed we will discuss these assumption and present how these underlying assumption resulted in a bad security architecture but before that we need to look at the various definitions perspectives and players involved in current security design security in the internet and communication systems had multiple definitions and they are all right in their limited scope initially security was defined as a system which performs only prespecified tasks and avoid accepting or interacting with unsafe or vulnerable system this definition of security does not fulfill the needs of modern internet and communication systems this is because the internet or current communication systems have multipurpose and multifunctional characteristics prespecifying the tasks of these systems will limit the utilization of these systems and this is not desirable moreover there are many7 unspecified tasks of the internet and communication systems security architecture was not designed to meet these diverse tasks designing a security architecture for upcoming generation of the internet and communication systems will be a very big challenge consumers definition of security is very different from the aforementioned definition consumers do not care about the specifications technological advancement physical limitations of device etc they only require a security which has negligible probability of evasion this makes security designers task more difficult another important aspect which is also relates with the consumer security definition is the tradeoff between security and privacy it is a special case of the tussle between service provider and users this tradeoff has not been handled properly in current communication and internet design this section will also discuss the issues and perspective solutions related to security and privacy tradeoff another definition of security is influenced by the economics and politics where security is defined as a cost effective system which is not only used for defence but sometime use for offence different couturiers have different legal social and economic laws and they influence the security architecture by imposing different restrictions and censorship this biased approach has caused a serious concerns in security designing professionals designing the internet and communication system security by keep the incentive for the investors and following the regional policies is another tradeoff that designers have to deal with this section will also explains this important tradeoff this diverse nature of security definitions and related tradeoffs depicts that the initial goal of designing a general security solution was flawed and we need to reconsider the security architecture that can handle all the necessary security requirements of consumer service providers application developers and regional authorities to answer this question we need to understand two major concepts flaws in previous security design and attack characterization flaws in previous security design will provide the initial design perspective and limitation details attack characterization is a process of learning the attacks dynamic behaviour and analyze it to form a defence mechanism against it a flaws in current security architecture in this subsection we will discuss the flaws in the internet and communication system security design we will follow a layered approach to describe the flaws in security architecture 1 physical layer links routers server and many other related hardware constitute physical layer and it is highly vulnerable to the local and remote attacks using carefully crafted cyber tools and hardware this layer also contains hardware related information encoding and signaling transmission and reception procedure and topological information of physical network design security architecture must ensure that this critical information stays private from unintended observer channellinks are susceptible to eavesdrop ping active and passive attacks adversarial attacks information theoretic attacks and many other related malfunctioning physical layer security of wireless system is bounded by two major imperfection of wireless channel namely fading and pathloss there are other related wireless channel imperfections caused by nature but current physical layer security design was not developed by taking into account these wireless channel limitations there are many security solution proposed to ensure security of the physical layer these security solution are based on the coding theory key generation game theory information theory and many other statistical and rule based schemes if we look at the service model and functional specifications of the physical layer they are best effort and weak functional specifications respectively best effort and weak functional specification means that hardware can malfunction attacker can tape the channel for information statistical approximation can go wrong no service guarantees are offered to the users these weak underlying design assumptions are the core reason of a bad security design for the physical layer these weak assumption raise multiple unanswered questions like how to characterize the security how to decide on a physical layer security design given the exponential raise in connected devices in upcoming communication generation the security of physical layer is also related to the layers above how to ensure the security coordination8 another related shortcoming in current wireless communication systems and the internet which act as a limiting factor in designing an appropriate physical layer security is the concept of security as a service as mentioned at the start of the section that security has multiple dimensions and these dimensions will keep increasing as we get into the next generation of communication in current security design for physical layer the security is considered as a service where hardware is placed in secure facilities and many coding techniques combined with encrypted key generation with trust sharing is used all these security fixes are rule based threshold based and contextless because the service base defence mechanism assume a uniform threat model the major question here is how to develop a dynamic threat model given all the aforementioned shortcomings in physical layer security we need to rethink the physical layer security for next generation of communication systems we need to make the dynamic threat models along with intelligent coordination among the layers this dynamic and robust physical layer security can be achieved by rethinking the cognition cycle and building a trust hierarchy based cognitive solution for physical layer 2 data link layer data link layer is responsible of moving packets from network layers to the host many attacks has been performed and proposed in literature ranging from address resolution protocol poisoning to authentication attacks on the wireless users in wireless domain data link layer has faced many security challenges such as hidden node attacks fake access point attacks authentication attacks mac flooding mac spoofing port stealing vlan hopping etc security in network is as strong as the weakest link once the weakest link is compromised rest of the communication system will be compromised in wireless communication networks and the internet data link layer can be a weakest link this layer is considered a possible weak link of security because this layer is not only attacked by the external attacker but also faces the insider threat challenge where a rouge employee can share the insider information with the adversary wireless channel has its own characteristics and these are exploited by attackers in deploying data link denial of service attacks where clear to send and request to send messages are flooded in the system which ultimately results in degraded quality of service similarly deauthenticaion attack where deauth frame is spoofed by the attacker because of low security results in disassociation of the user from wireless access point this attacks depicts a fundamental security understanding flaw where the initializing frame security is compromised to ensure immediate connectivity another example of data link layer poor security is the fake access point attack this attack is performed by spoofing the wireless beacon frames and intelligently crafting similar adversarial beacons and flooding the network with these adversarial beacons for the purposes of denying the connectivity to the legitimate user all the attacks and shortcoming explained are resulted because the current wireless data link layer model is just an upgrade of the wired data link layer model with multiple compromises to ensure wireless connectivity and availability data link layer security lacks the dynamic adaption from surrounding environment due to its static design and this results in flawed security architecture for data link layer since next generation communication systems are expected to be self organized we need to reconsider the data link security we need to design data link security as a part of a trust based system which has the ability to defend against the adversarial and insider attacks 3 network layer network layer is responsible for packet forwarding and routing through intermediate networks this layer offers no service guarantees as it is based on best effort delivery this underlying service structure causes lack of trust and coordination issues in developing security of network layer for next generation of communication systems network layer security is designed using ipsec protocol where encryption strategies are used to provide data confidentiality and data integrity this security works well but putting more encryption to secure data is not a good approach because attacker information will also get encrypted this reduces the probability of attacker detection and increases the complexity of network traffic analysis at the service provider end another important task of network layer is routing the current routing algorithms are does not possess the ability to learn from previous abnormalities and also lacks in technical security control given the expected heterogeneity and complexity of the future network these rule based and policy compliant routing9 algorithms does not fulfill the routing requirements to solve this problem a new intelligent realtime traffic control scheme with trusted hierarchy support is required tang et al 6 has proposed a new real time deep learning based intelligent traffic control system this system is based on deep convolutional neural networks with unique input and output characterization for wireless mesh network backbone mao et al 7 also proposed an intelligent routing method for future networks by utilizing deep boltzmann machine algorithms these new schemes are using deep machine learning technique but they have not considered security perspective of the network layer all these architectures and designs have to face two major challenges namely trust hierarchy andmigration problem trust hierarchy is a scheme where communication entities uses trusted authentication mechanism via mutually shared like public key algorithm or trusted third party based authentication system in future intelligent communication system this trust based network layer protocol is still an open research problem switching to new routing schemes with trust based authentication scheme at once will be very difficult at the global scale this falls under the umbrella of social and economics problem we need a new social contract with economic incentives for the users and service providers to switch to this new secure intelligent scheme 4 transport layer transport layer is responsible for end to end communication in the network this layer provides logical communication between application process running on different hosts transport layer provides synchronized in order and guaranteed delivery with flow control and encrypted security previously it is possible to build a closed form tractable model of transport layer behavior because networks were simpler rule based and less diverse future communication systems are complex and heterogeneous building a closed form behavior model to predict the change in the network is not a tractable solution 8 current security architecture of transport layer largely dependent upon cryptographic algorithms cryp tography is a very powerful tool to ensure security but given the scale of the future networks this solution will become a hazard due to expected diverse security needs in future internet and wireless communication systems as we increase the number of devices complex connectivity and multiple levels of security requirements cryptographic algorithms turns all the attacks on the different planes into an attack on availability and this is not desirable cryptography algorithms will not provide unevadable security to the transport layer because of flawed endtoend service model transport layer also faces the session hijacking where an adversary hijacks the control on the session between two nodes this is an attack on availability of the network and these attacks occurs because current wireless and internet architecture does not dynamically learn from the previous information of session hijacking 5 application layer application layer is the only layer which interacts with the users and provides full access to the user applications in future networks application layer is considered to be the most crowded and problematic layer user application design and its complexity is only limited by human imaginations this causes a very serious security threat to this layer the major security flaw in application layer lies in the diverse specifications of applications and their security requirements there is no single threat model for dealing with this diversity issue another design flaw in application layer that limits the security of this layer is the lack of coordination with the other layers applications designers are not aware of security issues of other layers and this lack of coordination turns the diversity of application into a hazard application layer security is also compromised due to social and financial conventions it is application layer that defines how network will behave as all other layers are only responsible of their fix actions on the received packets many of the security risks we face now a days are due to bad design choices and compromises in application layer since applications are designed to facilitate the user requirements and this involves money applications developer does not take into consideration the security architecture of the whole communication or internet stack today applications are designed to have more powerful functionality and features to raise finances to do this developer takes security risks such as using active codes such as java scripts and causes a communication and security risks this application layer design approach is known as insecure by design and considered to be the root cause of the major security breaches in communication and internet architecture10 iii b arriers to better security the issues in current wireless and data networks security explained in section ii this section enlists the major challenges that network community need to solve to ensure better security for next generation of communication systems a self organization selforganization so has been defined as learning from the environment and adapting the statistical variations in input stimuli to achieve highly reliable communications whenever and wherever needed the growth in communication devices data hungry application and diverse security requirements has changed the focus of research community from static rule based security to dynamic learning security architectures since user behavior and user application requirements are only bounded by the human imagination the underlying service architecture of current communication system is not good enough to cope with the dynamic security requirements of these applications we need to build a self organization based security in each layerto ensure a better security for next generation of communication systems the desired security requires automated real time measurements and inference on each layer and adapt accordingly to ensure consumers and operators trust on the security b tussles in cyberspace current communication and internet security architecture has different stake holders with aligned or adverse alignment of interests current communication and data network security does not take into consid erations these tussles two major tussles in security architectures are namely useroperator and governments andsecurity and privacy any security architecture design for the future networks have to deal with these tussles design by choice modulerization and cognitive design are the way forward in dealing with tussles design by choice involves offering more control to all stakeholders by designing an intelligent cognitive security architecture in the tussle space 9 1 tussle between user operator and governments this tussle describes the adverse alignment of goals between user operator and government user want an unevadeable security operator wants more control on user traffic for qos traffic analysis and other network performance evaluation where as government want to impose their security policies and these policies are inline with their socioeconomic goals current security architecture lacks in the ability of dealing with this tussle application of cryptography is a very related example to this tussle as user uses multilayer encryption to ensure its security operator does not want this level of encryption because this makes traffic analysis and detection of malicious user very difficult governments want a full control on user and operator operations to use security for user profiling intelligence tracking and other related tasks 2 tussle between security and privacy this tussle is a special case of useroperator and government tussle this tussle has its roots is social behaviors current security architecture of the communication and data network was not designed by keeping in view the social needs of the consumer consumer normally confuses data security with privacy data security is related to confidentiality integrity and integrity of the data whereas privacy is related to right of personal privacy regarding the storing and usage of the user data this tussle has turned into an arms race where users are employing different security techniques to keep their data private and operators are restricting them to ensure security of the network by detecting dos and ddos attacks another example of this tussle is the consumer profiling by different operators and consumer data selling to advertising agencies this has been a major concern in networking community and network designers have to find a balance between security and privacy c lack of systems thinking wireless and data networks were designed is based on a lego approach of learning where we optimize the network operations as separate entities this optimization approach does not posses the ability of dealing11 with the requirements of future communication systems because this independent optimization can cause the unintended consequences on the performance of any other component in the system for example major security problem in current wireless and data networks is due to the lack of coordination among the layers for example to provide powerful functionality application developer does not care for the security issues caused by the design choice made similarly greedy capacity achieving coding technique at the physical layer does not take into account the decoder complexity for future network security should be designed as a system rather than as a service iv n ewwireless paradigm in this section we will present a new cognitive wireless networking design which employees self organization and machine learning to overcome the shortcomings of current wireless and data communication networks mentioned in section i this new design is based on the new improved cognition cycle which not only incorporate the sensing and adapting from surroundings but also involves the knowledge base to ensure systems thinking a improved cognition cycle the cognitive wireless network is motivated by the shortcomings of current networking architecture previous crosslayer network design and cognitive radios design these shortcomings have their basis in in creasing complexity heterogeneity and dynamic networking environments to overcome these shortcomings cognitive wireless networks are expected to be selforganized in future communication systems by employing new network design approaches state of the art machine learning techniques and improved cognition cycle this selforganization can be achieved by introducing a learning and adapting mechanism in configuration optimization and healing process this complexity driven approach set the basis for designing the underlying theory of selforganizing networks intentdriven networks knowledgebased networks software defined networks and many other intelligent networking architectures cognitive wireless networks operation can be summarized in two steps namely cognition andreconfig urability in sensing process cognitive wireless network sense for wireless channel statistics interference estimation and event detection these sensed attributes are then used for building an artificial intelligence in the network whereas reconfigurability stands for adaption of the intelligent decision analyze the radio channel and spectrum usage from surroundings intelligently reconfigure the network operation parameters to select the optimal frequency band for transmission signal processing and machine learning techniques are used to provide cognition and software defined radio is used for providing reconfigurablity figure 1 depicts the new improved cognitive wireless network cycle it also represents the core tasks of the major components and the information flow between these components 1 radio sensing sensing it provides the details about wireless channel sensing network traffic statis tics interference detectionestimation and observing an event the raw information gathered in sensing process describes the characteristics of primary user spectrum radio sensing is also responsible for sensing the activity of primary users when the licensed spectrum is reclaimed this activity sensing helps cognitive wireless networks in avoiding the interference and improve the overall endtoend reliability of the network 2 knowledge base analysis storage in this step the radio network telemetry for the primary user is performed which involves event correlation anomaly detection performance monitoring metric calculation trend analysis network semantics and many other related measurements knowledge base also records all the decision made in previous cognition and reconfigurability cycles along with a set of available actions based on operator policy to improve the endtoend network performance knowledge base combined with intelligent decision making act as a brain of the network which processes the12 fig 1 cognitive wireless network cycle this figure highlights the major components involved in the cognitive wireless networking sensed input and makes an intelligent decision estimation and decision making is another important component of the cognitive wireless network 3 estimation decision making reasoning this step involves the detection of spectrum holes based on the knowledge base information gathered by sensing and processing the spectrum information of the primary users once the spectrum hole is detected a dynamic spectrum manager and handoff procedure enables the secondary user to pick the best frequency this also involves machine learning for channel prediction throughput transmitter capacity or any other customized intelligent decision making with the evolution of deep learning and other efficient unsupervised learning techniques estimation and decision making process in the cognitive wireless network has improved and in turn improved the overall reliability of the cognitive wireless network 4 wireless access link control adapting estimation and decision making section provides the information of channel prediction based on spectrum holes transmitter capacity etc wireless access and link control section of the network implements the reconfiguration based on the provided information a tighter power control is provided by wireless access and link control section in order to keep the interference caused by secondary users to the primary users and the interference among secondary users similarly the competition for spectrum resource is also handled by wireless access and link control section by employing different game theoretic approaches another very important element of the cognitive wireless network is spectrum mobility which ensures the desired qos of primary users mean while providing a resilient service to the secondary users in cognitive wireless network spectrum mobility is defined as the process by which a cognitive wireless13 network user alters its frequency of operation for using the spectrum dynamically allowing radio terminals to operate in the best available frequency band and in case of primary users reappearance ensures a smooth communication to the secondary user with low latency during handoff process spectrum mobility and handoff process proved to be very useful in the multihop cognitive wireless network where we need to relay and route information between dynamically changing channels the cognitive wireless network is a key enabler for nextgeneration communication technologies and due to its wide range of applicability it is a hot topic for research in academia and industry it has many potential applications in wireless sensor networks bluetooth emergency wireless networks vehicular networks smart grids machine to machine communication adhoc wireless networks and most importantly in 5g communications v c onclusion in this report i have discussed the design challenges in wireless and data networks i have discussed issues in the security of current wireless and data networking architecture i have also proposed an improved cognition cycle which includes knowledge base to ensures systems thinking by incorporating advances in machine learning and big data future work will include the details of each block of the improved knowledge base and its

and mitigation of this type of content this work provides an outline of our recently launched initiative to develop a contextaware framework we also present the rudimentary results of the lynching of priyantha kumara diyawadana to illustrate the impact of online extremist propaganda on social media platforms our results indicate that nearly 25 of the total population included in the gathered data have a negative sentiment toward the lynching of priyantha kumara diyawadana demonstrating how extreme hatemongering ex tremist narratives are affecting social media users keywords extremism social media platforms twitter lynching i i ntroduction extremism is becoming a daunting problem in the modern world the attacks on mosques in christchurch gun vio lence in schools in the us the terrorism wave in canada and the middle east religious and racial violence episodes in eu rope riots and lynching in india and pakistan the genocide in rohingya etc are a few of the horrific examples where extremist ideologies on social media have resulted into real world tragedies governments and social media giants are trying to deal with this issue but unfortunately there hasnt been any notable success extremism is a subjective term identifying and quantifying it is an open area of research because of its connections with various cultural religious political and technological aspects extremist content is an amalgamation of fake news misinterpreted religious literature misdisinformation outofcontext videoaudio clips hateful blogs search engine optimized hashtags pro paganda videosliterature deepfakes and abuse all online extremist ideas begin in the offline world schools theolog ical seminaries literature ideas of revenge and supremacy etc and the butterfly effect of social media and content optimization algorithms makes it viral this availability and virality of extremist content increase online extremism and in many cases into realworld extremism episodes identify ing and moderating social media content while preserving free speech and privacy is a challenging task solving this problem requires content moderation techniques and platformlevel policies the lack of an extremism detection and prevention framework notably in india and pakistan is leading in the continual distribution of extremist content via social media apps this work outlines a framework for extremist content identification and mitigation the project has only recently begun the complete summary of the project is depicted in figure 1 and in this poster we discusspreliminary results using the horrific lynching incident of priyantha kumara diyawadana as a use case ii r elated work in recent years social media applications have emerged as the most powerful tool for inciting

        "prompt": "bringing the internet to the remaining billions of people left without will democratize knowledge open up new opportunities and undoubtedly open up avenues for sustained development the overwhelming focus of the internet research community has been on improving the ideal networking experience by providing increasingly higher throughputs along with lower latencies however this focus has led to an internet design that is very costly which has precluded the global deployment of the internet we see this in wired technologies such as the modern fiberbased broadband highspeed network which come close to providing ideal network performance have largely been restricted to urban centers and advanced countries with economical reasons primarily the high cost of laying fiber precluding their universal deployment similarly cellular technologydespite its great successhas not been able to ensure gaia since it is mainly an urban phenomena that cannot be used to cost effectively serve rural and remote areas 23 since internet is overengineered for many practical applications and needs ie not all applications and users of the internet require highfidelity internet services we argue that a viable gaiaenabling approach is the use of approximate networking where contextappropriate tradeoffs are adopted to deal with different challenges and impairments characterizing a certain region we can loosely define approximate networks as networks that are close to ideal in terms of quality nature and quantity we proposed the concept of approximate networking previously in 4 where the presentation of the concept focused on the use of simple approximate goodenough services to tame the complexity of the networking infrastructure in a future world afflicted with hard limits due to the exhaustion of natural resources such as fossil fuels in this paper we argue that apart from its clear use in reducing network complexity with the complementary benefits of more sustainable cheaper services approximate networking can also be used to satisfy the widelydiffering and diverse user requirements by taking contextappropriate tradeoffs and thereby help in realizing the vision of global access to the internet for all gaia our main idea is for universal internet provisioning of mobile and internet services that it is time to move away from pursuing overengineered perfect products and focus instead on developing appropriate good enough solutions our approximate networking idea can be thought of as the network analog of the emerging computer architectural trend called approximate computing 56 which we discuss next 11 what is approximate computing broadly speaking approximate computing leverages the capability of many computing systems and applications to tolerate some loss of quality and optimality by trading off precision for efficiency where efficiency can be in the terms of increased performance or reduced costs in terms of energy consumed or system costarea approximate computing systems are able to optimize the efficiency of systems by relaxing the commonly applied notion of exact numerical or boolean equivalence between the specification and implementation at multiple layers of the hardware and software stacks see figure 1 for a depiction the use of approximate computing is motivated by the following factors 1 modern big data applications are based on noisy realworld data 2 many computing applications eg recommendation and web search do not have a single golden answer 3 the perceptual limitations of users mean that some approximations may not even be noticed and 4 many applications existeg images video and soundwhere minor errors and approximations can be tolerated by different users some recent case studies for applying approximate computing to video processing 7 signal processing 8 and communication systems 9 have shown early feasibility the research in the field of approximate computing has been led by seminal contributions from the industry players such as intel 10 ibm 1112 and microsoft 13 as well as several research groups from academia 561416future internet 2017 9 94 3 of 23 figure 1 whats new about approximate computing adapted from 617 12 what is approximate networking with approximate networking we intend to seamlessly integrate the concepts from approximate computing along with traditional mechanisms for approximations in networking in terms of approximations adopted by networking protocols and algorithms the concept of approximate networking is necessary since experience has shown us that universal commissioning of ideal networks which have extremely high capacity bandwidth and reliability in addition to extremely low or negligible delays errors and congestion is nonpractical it is important to emphasize that approximate networking is not a single standalone technique nor is it the first time that approximation has been proposed in networking indeed a number of existing networking techniques already utilize approximation and are best effort our idea of approximate networking generalizes these classical ideas and importantly supplements these ideas with recent developments in the field of crosslayered approximate computing particularly at the hardware level to facilitate the design of future energyefficient and optimized network infrastructure as well as algorithms and protocols we aim to enable end to end approximation principlesframeworks engaging hardwaresoftware approximation as well as network layer approximations for systematic approximate networking as this point in time there has only been rudimentary work done in efficiently combining lowlevel approximate computing modules to construct larger highlevel modules and architectural components approximate computing has been deployed for a large number of applications including image processing signal processing machine learning scientific computing financial analysis database search and distributed computing however its extension to the field of networking is practically nonexistent at this point in time with only some recent preliminary works as exceptions 1819 we anticipate that these hardwarefocused approximate computing advances will percolate into the field of networking and in the future there will be an increased interest in synergistic approximation management at different layers of the hardware and software stacks in networking 13 why adopt approximate networking 131 affordable universal internet gaia the right of affordable access to broadband internet is enshrined in the 2015 sustainable development goals of the united nations the international telecommunication union itu broadband goal 2020 initiative aims at an optimistic target of universal broadband internet speeds of 20 mbps for 20 a month accessible to everyone in the world by 2020 source alliance for affordable internet a4ai report 2014 such an approach which aims at providing an ideal networking experience universally has historically always failed due to various socioeconomical and technical issues an important reason is that most modern technologies such as 3g 4g longterm evolution lte and the planned 5g are urban focused as rural systems being sparsely populated by definition do not thus hold much business potential for mobile carriers 23 the internet is alsofuture internet 2017 9 94 4 of 23 large unaffordable when we consider that on average the mobile broadband price and the fixedline broadband prices are 12 and 40 of the average persons monthly income where women and rural populations are hit the hardest 20 approximate networking is a particularly appealing option to reach out to the offline human population by providing an affordable contextually good enough service 132 diversity of user application profiles the internets digital divide is not a binary divide there is a spectrum of connectivity options and digital capabilities accessible to people around the world see figure 2 in some places ultra highspeed broadband connections are available while there are hosts of places where there is no connectivity at all however most places lie somewhere in between user and application profiles and requirement vary greatly at one extreme we have applications that require extremely high throughput eg video on demand and low latency eg tactile internet on the other extreme we have applications that have minimal throughput and latency requirements eg smart meters which report back lowvolume data relatively infrequently users can also have vastly different service requirements and financial strength in the face of such great diversity the approximate networking framework can avoid the difficulties of singlesizefitsall networking solutions furthermore these diversities can be exploited and applications and users provided services and resources commensurate to their requirements figure 2 ensuring global access to the internet for all gaia requires provisioning good enough quality of service qos that accommodates the diversity of applications requirements device capabilities user profile and requirements 133 the pareto principle 8020 law the power of good enough to help manage the approximate networking tradeoffs it is instructive to remember the pareto principle alternatively called the 8020 rule 21 which states roughly that 20 of the factors result in 80 of the overall effect this principle has big implications for approximate networking since this allows us to provide adequate fidelity to ideal networking by only focusing on the most important 20 of the effects the key challenge in approximate networking then becomes the task of separating the allimportant essential nontrivial factors from the trivial factors which may be omitted or approximated in this regard we can leverage previous humancomputerinteraction hci research that has shown that human quality of service qos perception can be flawed eg relatively fast service may be judged to be unacceptable if the service is not predictable visually appealing andfuture internet 2017 9 94 5 of 23 reliable 22 in choosing the precise approximate networking tradeoff to adopt such that the users perceive the least inconvenience 134 need of energy efficiency it has been reported that information and communication technology ict is one of the biggest consumer of the worlds electrical energy using up to 5 of the overall energy 2012 statistics 23 the urgency of delivering on the front of energy efficiency is reinforced by the impending decline of nonrenewable energy resources along with the concomitant increase in ict demand the approximate networking trend can augment the hardwarefocused approximate computing trend in managing the brewing energy crisis through the ingenuous use of approximation in particular approximate networking can help generalize the performance and efficiency improvements offered by approximate computing which have largely been limited to local speedups on a single device to broader network settings optimizing communicationnetworking cost is important since these costs can be significant eg on mobile phones the wifi and cellular radios require on average an order of magnitude more power than the cpu or memory 18 14 contributions of this paper the main contribution of this paper is to investigate the extension of the concept of approximate computing to the field of networking we propose approximate networking as an overarching crosslayered framework that encompasses classical approximation techniques as well as recentlydeveloped techniques in the field of approximate computing to implement contextappropriate networking tradeoffs that are necessary for the aims of global access to the internet for all gaia in order to facilitate these tradeoffs apart from the classical approximation techniques adopted in networking in the areas of softwarehardware algorithms protocols and architecture approximate networking will also leverage the advances in the fastemerging field of approximate computing as an extra degreeoffreedom for finergrained tradeoff optimization we also propose approximate networking as an overarching framework for systematically thinking about networking tradeoffs that must be adopted for ensuring gaia furthermore we also present an application of approximate networking in 5g with a case for low income and rural regions this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes approximate networking technologies in section 3 we present contextappropriate approximate tradeoffs for networking we describe a case study for approximate 5g networks in rural and low income areas in section 4",

the use of caching and opportunistic communication are all approximate networking solutions in this classical sense the user datagram protocol udp protocol approximates the transport service provided

of the internet eg servicesfuture internet 2017 9 94 6 of 23 that rely on data mules eg daknet 25 are only infrequency connected to the internet there other also services such as outernet 26 and internet in a box 27 that approximate the internet experience without actually connecting to the internet the novel aspect of approximate networking is that it can leverage advances in hardwarebased approximate computing developments in particular researchers can utilize crosslayer approximation across the computing stack refer to figure 1 where the stack contains in addition to the networking programming languages compilers operating systemsdatabases and hardware architectures for instance approximate programming languages such as enerj enerc etc can be used to specify the critical and the noncritical aspects of computation eg enerj is a general purpose programming language built as an extension to java that exposes hardware faults in a safe principled manner results have shown large amounts of energy savings with slight sacrifices to qos the same general idea applies to networking devices such as switches and routers where not all operations are equivalentsome aspects have to be precise while others can be approximate approximate computing can be used to differentially specify the critical parts of the program and the less critical parts depending upon their inherent resilience properties see resilience characterization in 14 in this manner approximate networking can have greater support from the hardware in implementing contextappropriate approximations a representative taxonomy of approximate networking concepts is shown in figure 3 a summary of some sample works related to the various facets of approximate networking taxonomy highlighted in the taxonomy presented in is also presented in table 1 for illustrative purposes 22 approximate networking hardware with physical limits beginning to stall the exponential growth of electronics due to moores law and the dennards scaling it seems to be the case that future hardware devices and by extension future network switches and routers will use approximate computing in one way or another in terms of hardware support networking in most end user devices such as smartphones tablets laptops and embedded devices such as smart tv is implemented using applicationspecific integrated circuits asics these endnodes are general purpose computing devices that have networkinterfacecards nics built in for connecting to networks in contrast we also have specialized networking devices such as routers switches hubs and firewalls that function as the building blocks of networks such devices have in addition to nics also switching fabrics and use various techniques such as memorybased computing through ternarycontentaddressablememories tcams networking devices also utilize a number of components memory hierarchy of static ram sram dynamic ram dram nonvolatile ram nvram hardware parallelism using ternary content addressable memory tcam multiplexers and demultiplexers and counters which are all amenable to approximate computing as explained in 28 two principal components of network hardware are 1 the implementation of packet processing logic through combinational logic and 2 memory based components in implementing combinational logic there are two approximating options firstly the elementary building blocks of approximate adder and multiplier which are typically implemented in arithmetic logic units and are used in counters already have an approximate computing implementation that return impressive gains 28 such adders and counters can be used in implementing the set of counters maintained by the simple network management protocol snmp that is implemented by all routers today secondly the complex logic in a larger circuit can be replaced with an approximate optimized pseudoequivalent circuit when implementing memory in networking devices approximation can be implemented at the level of sram dram and tcams approximate caches have been built that avoid cache misses by using approximation based on temporal and spatial correlation present in data stored in memory this can be used to avoid expensive powerhungry access of dram furthermore the power consumed in accessing dram can be reduced through refresh rate control using which the errorpower tradeoff

voltage overscaling using which the voltage is deliberately reduced for improving power efficiency of circuits such a technique can be used in approximate networking to build hybrid memories with power efficient unreliable memory arrays that can drastically improve power efficiency through aggressive voltage overscaling approximate networking can also use functional approximation at various levels particularly at the architectural circuitlevel and at the transistor level this can include the use of neural networks for learning a simplified approximation of code 28 we note here that approximate computing technology is not limited to generalpurpose central processing unit cpu architecture only companies are already resorting to approximate computing to obtain energy and cost optimized applicationspecific integrated circuits asics eg google has made a custom asic named the tensor processing unit to run machine learningbased tasks at scale in their data centers while requiring fewer transistor per operation similarly ibm exploited the error resilience of deep neural networks to loss of numerical precision for better area and power efficiency systems 12 we believe it is only a matter of time before these ideas would find way to network asics and that more research is needed on how these technologies will interplay with the networklayer stack 23 approximate networking software algorithms implementing approximate networking can be useful in many scenarios where aspects of a system such as ease of use functionality and robustness may be more important than performance alone the idea of approximation is an oftused tool in networking algorithms 45 approximate networking algorithms 46 also called heuristics are often required in networking to tackle discrete optimization problems many of which are nphard and thus there are no efficient algorithms to find optimal solutions such algorithms have been widely used in scheduling routing and qos problems in networking in the book network algorithmics 45 varghese has distilled 15 important highperformance principles that have wide applicability in networks many of which are based on efficient approximations and tradeoffs in particular principle 3 talks of trading certainty for time p3a and trading accuracy for time p3b with p3a randomized strategies are used when deterministic algorithms may be too slow eg the use of randomization in deciding when to transmit after a collision in millions of ethernets worldwide with p3b the idea is to relax accuracy requirements for speed eg by using lossy compression approximation thresholds approximate sorting and approximate set membership query algorithms such as the bloom filter and cuckoo filter in particular bloom filters which is a highspeed approximate set membership query algorithm whose tests that can return false positives but never false negatives have been extensively applied in networking in a wide variety of settings 47 bloom filters are important since a large number of applications require fast matching of arbitrary identifiers to values since it is common to have millions or even billions of entries we require efficient and scalable methods for storing updating and querying tables although bloom filters can return a few false positives their real utility is in alleviating the scaling problems that a number of diverse network applications face broder and mitzenmacher have articulated the bloom filter principle 47 whenever a list or set is used and space is at a premium consider using a bloom filter if the effect of false positives can be mitigated bloom filters have been used for diverse ends in networking and distributed systems such as caching peertopeer systems routing and forward and monitoring and measurement 47 code perforation is another softwarebased approximate computing technique that can be used to automatically identify errorresilient portions within a code that can be skipped while keeping the error within a predefined range 6future internet 2017 9 94 10 of 23 24 approximate networking protocol stack various approximations have already been adopted by transportlayer protocols to handle multimedia traffic over the besteffort internet datagram congestion control protocol dccp can provide congestion control services without the reliability overhead of tcp udp is approximate in the sense that it trades off reliability for efficiency and rapidness udplite 40 is a connectionless protocol that approximates the performance of udp but it uses partial checksums thus while udp always discards packets that fail checksums udplite relaxes the integrity checks to deliver timely but potentially partially erroneous packets to multimedia applications udplite is designed for accelerating errortolerant realtime multimedia streaming applications that can tolerate slight errors while udplite can provide a significant throughput improvement by relaying partially corrupted packets to the application layer 18 care must be adopted to ensure that 1 there does not exist a conflict between the linklayer checksum eg 80211 fcs and the udplite checksum which can result in the link layer refusing to carry damaged data and 2 the additional throughput is not in carrying useless data for the applicationthis may require the use of erasureerror protection at the application layer approximate packet processing circuits that return imprecise answers will have the benefit that they will be much smaller than those today they would consume less power and many more of them could fit on a single chip greatly increasing the number of packets it could process at once however a critical question is how these imprecise packet processing affect the performance of higherlayer networking stack since the approximate networking technology is inchoate we cannot answer with certainty how the lowlevel hardwarebased approximate computing developments will affect the performance of the network upperlayer stack however we can definitely foresee the need to approximation semantics at the upper layers of the networking stack so that hardwarelevel approximate computing features can be efficiently utilized otherwise the potential benefits of approximation will be frittered away as the network may attempt a reliable and precise transfer of approximate data some approximate networking semantics naturally exists as part of the tcpip stack eg through the best effort service provided by the udp and ip protocols there have been many disparate efforts at the transport layer which can be categorized as approximate networking efforts standard reliable transport protocols like tcp work well for file transfer applications but are too unwieldy for multimedia applications that prioritize speed of transfer and have some error tolerance to ensure that we have appropriate communication support for approximate data some essential mechanisms that should be supported include 19 1 optional multilayer integrity check support currently the different network layers perform redundant checksums eg tcp over wifi uses three separate checksums namely the tcp layer the ip layer and the link layer in an approximate networking context it is useful to permit some errors in approximate payloads 2 partial integrity checking for critical data eg addresses and ports must be precise it is typical in networking to discard erroneous packets that have been received with checksum errors both tcp and udp discard erroneous packets tcp also asks for a retransmission to ensure reliability however in the spirit of approximation partial errors in noncritical data can be tolerated udplite 40 is an example transport protocol that performs partial integrity checking through the use of a configurable checksum which specifies how many bits are protected by checksum 3 applicationprovided approximation specification and switching between these specifications for a given socket at the level of different layers as an example work selective approximate protocol sap 18 allows applications to coordinate with multiple networks layers to accept potentially damaged data the authors of sap which is built over udplite have reported a 30 speedup for an errortolerant file transfer application over wififuture internet 2017 9 94 11 of 23 3 contextappropriate approximate networking tradeoffs 31 tradeoffs in networking in a complex system such as the internet and the networking tcpip ecosystem in which multiple subsystems work in silos isolated from each other there is a danger that improvementsimplification of one subsystem may increase the complexity of some of the other subsystems and deteriorate their performance we propose that approximate networking ecosystem as a holistic systemsoriented framework that can offer contextappropriate management of the various tradeoffs involved in networking in terms of performance cost and complexity some of these tradeoffs are discussed below fidelity versus affordabilityconvenience a lot of research has shown that customers are willing to sacrifice considerable fidelity for a more convenient and accessible service 48 the notion of fidelity matches with the qos quality of experience qoe concept convenience subsumes concepts such as the cost accessibilityavailability and simplicity of the service the fact that users are willing to tradeoff fidelity for convenience and affordability is an extremely important insight for our topic latency versus throughput it is well known in literature that throughputoptimal solutions can compromise performance in terms of delay 49 the sneakernet concept long known in networking folklore never underestimate the bandwidth of a station wagon full of tapes hurtling down the highway andrew tanenbaum 1981 is the embodiment of the latencythroughput tradeoff in a similar vein dtn routing protocols also tradeoff latency for throughput and connectivity ie dtn bundles can achieve the same throughput as ip protocols but with longer latency throughput versus coveragereliability in wireless networks there is a tradeoff between the throughput and the coverage and the reliability of a transmission ie for higherrate transmissions the coverage area is typically smaller and the bit error rate higher the idea of approximate networking can be used to provide contextappropriate qos to 5g users 3 by provisioning higher rates to users and applications where feasible and desired while still allowing everyone access to basic connectivity allowing users who are currently offline to come online coverage versus consumed power in wireless networks the coverage of a transmission is directly proportional to the transmission power since nodes do not need to communicate at all times researchers have proposed putting to sleep parts of the infrastructure such as the base transceiver station bts of cellular systems to save on energy costs other tradeoffs many innovative solutions are able to improve performance by inventing a new tradeoff for example vulimiri et al discovered that an interesting way to reduce latency is to tradeoff some additional capacity or redundancy ie the authors showed that latency can be reduced by by initiating redundant operations across diverse resources and using the first complete response 50 future approximate networking solutions can derive much utility by focusing on discovering new ways of developing contextappropriate new tradeoffs 32 leveraging approximation when dealing with contextappropriate tradeoffs that come with approximate networking an important concept is that of pareto optimality which refers to a state of resource allocation in which it is not possible to make any one individual better off without making at least one individual worse off the set of values that are each pareto optimal together constitute the pareto frontier the main benefit of using approximate networking is that it can leverage the degreeoffreedom of leveraging errors to shift the pareto frontier see the tradeoff being depicted in figure 4 such that performance and cost may be improved simultaneously at the cost of some inaccuracy which is designed to be under the threshold necessary for acceptable qosfuture internet 2017 9 94 12 of 23 figure 4 leveraging the extra degree of freedom of exploiting errors can improve performance while reducing cost 33 how can we visualize the tradeoffs an interesting approach to understanding tradeoffs is to use visualization techniques in approximate networking the task for optimizing for one explicit parameter is easier than optimizing for multiple optimization variables such as throughput delay and energy the main problem arises when the various objectives are conflicting and have to compete for dominance",

contrast to the plethora of 5g research projects aiming for high performance the coverage of rural and lowincome areas in future 5g networks despite its great importance has received relatively little attention although that has begun to change with few recent works 35556 for rural areas the mainfuture internet 2017 9 94 14 of 23 challenge is costeffective coverage rather than the urban focus on high data rates and low latency the highperformance urban 5g requirements dictate the need of a complex and expensive network comprising inter alia highcapacity fronthaul and backhaul networks dense heterogenous networks and large datacenters supporting such an architecture requires significant revenues which will be hard to obtain in rural environments that have very few inhabitants compared to urban environments the weak business cases for telecommunication operators in serving rural areas can be observed from a previous study 57 which showed that the approximate revenue potential for operators in the leastdensely populated areas is merely 262 usd per square mile of service compared to 248000 usd per square mile of service for highlydense urban populations figure 6 percentage of population who can afford 500 mb and 100 mb prepaid mobile data per month 58 researchers are actively sketching out the details of the technologies that will drive the future 5g wireless networks the unprecedented performance requirements of 5g will drive an increase in the overall energy consumption of cellular networks and in its carbon footprints the evolution of cellular networks over its various generations and the massive increase in performance as well as energy consumed by cellular radio access networks rans over time can be seen clearly in figure 7 satisfying these exacting requirements requires 1 greater spectrum efficiency which may be defined as the number of bits transferred per second per hertz or bshz as well as 2 better energy efficiency which refers to the energy consumed to communicate an information bit measured in joulesbit the spectral efficiency se and energy efficiency ee of wireless networks has been well studied in literature 5960 unfortunately there is a tradeoff between higher spectral efficiency and higher energy efficiency which may be expressed by the following equation for the case of an additive white gaussian noise awgn channel heehse no2hse11 where nois the noise power spectral density the se vs ee tradeoff however is complex for practical systems and becomes bell shaped when circuit power pcis considered figure 8 shows the tradeoff comparison for different values of circuit power some of the emerging 5g trends such as small cells can be good for energy efficiency as it has been shown that reducing the cell size can increase the number of bits delivered per unit energy for given user density and total power in the service area similarly the hetnet arrangement of overlaying a macrocell with micropicocells at the edge can also help save energy 61 figure 9 illustrates a better se vs ee tradeoff for lte pico cells as compared to lte micro cells and global system for mobile communication gsmfuture internet 2017 9 94 15 of 23 figure 7 a timeline of historical evolution of cellular networks and the expected electricity consumption of radio access networkran 62 researchers have demonstrated that 5g has a rich design space with many potential tradeoffs 60 such as deployment efficiency vsenergy efficiency spectrum efficiency vsenergy efficiency bandwidth vs power and latency vs power a comparison of parameters for the various 5g use cases are shown in figure 10 mainstream 5g research has taken up the challenge of providing highquality 5g service with gusto but such an approach will result in an overengineered system that will be too expensive to install and maintain for lowincome andor rural areas by suitably scaling the level of service 5g can encompass a broader coverage base as an example the requirement for supporting highdefinition hd video and tactile internet may be dropped in lowincome scenarios but may be supported for urban and highincome rural environments since the rural users would likely prefer goodenough service to no service researchers can explore using the traditional 5g tradeoffs in conjunction with the newly developed flexibility of approximate computing and approximate networking to produce cost effective solutions for lowincome andor rural areas figure 8 spectral energy vs energy efficiency tradeoffs for different circuit powers adapted from 63future internet 2017 9 94 16 of 23 figure 9 spectral energy vs energy efficiency tradeoffs for various wireless technologies adapted from 63 figure 10 the different requirements of the various 5g use cases adapted from resources made available by the european telecommunications standards institute etsi httpwwwetsiorg we can also use techniques that bring us more flexibility and convenience in reducing the cost of networking with techniques such as using 1 renewable energy sources such as solar power 2 base station sleep modes 3 the building blocks proposed in approximate computing literature such as the digital baseband processors proposed in 16 for 5g infrastructure such as base stations 4 virtualization of network components using techniques such as network functions virtualization nfv 5 exploitation of commodity hardware 6 using community networking and resource pooling principles 7 achieving flexibility using a separation of control and data planes and 8 achieving flexibility by integrating software defined networks sdn and nfv 64 using such technologies coupled with a wellthought out approximate networking design it is feasible to provide contextuallyappropriate goodenough services in a sustainable fashion at a low cost in the order of 1 usd for lowincome regions and 10 usd for rural regions chiaraviglio et al 65 have proposed a mix of lowcost solutions and techniques to bring 5g to rural and lowincome regions for instance remote radio heads rrhs can be mounted on unmanned aerial vehicle and balloons low cost solar powered large cells with coverage radius in the order of 50 km and delay tolerant networks for 5g to provide cellular access in rural areas this mixture was proposed considering the application context of rural areas which comprised basic delay tolerant connectivity that could support applications such as ehealth elearning and emergency services an economic analysis of these techniques in 56 showed a monthly subscription fee of 11 euros for rural areas of italy and cook islands and a monthly subscription fee of 1 euro for lowincomefuture internet 2017 9 94 17 of 23 but slightly more populated rural areas of zimbabwe this shows the viability of a lowcost but still functional approximate 5g networking service another way we can adopt approximate networking in 5g in rural and lowincome regions is to allow more simultaneous transmissions by multiple users in each orthogonal resource block be it a time slot a frequency channel or a spreading code using nonorthogonal multiple access noma noma is now being considered as a front runner 5g technology since it is compatible with conventional orthogonal multiple access techniques such as tdma and ofdma noma can allow for a contextappropriate tradeoff by catering to varied channel conditions at the users and by allocating more power to the user with poorer channel conditions or adjusting the power to facilitate the respective contextappropriate qos requirements using the cognitive radio noma crnoma variant it can be ensured that some or all of the users qos requirements are satisfied noma also allows chunking of users into multiple groups which can then be served in the same orthogonal block using multicarrier noma and different groups are allocated different orthogonal resource blocks this can facilitate management of contextappropriate tradeoffs for a large numbers of users that can be logically organized in different user classesgroups community networking and resource pooling is another enabling general architectural tool for rural area 5g networking 66 these efforts are being given a boost by open source technologies and plummeting prices of commodity hardware eg the introduction of low cost software defined radios and open source softwares such as openbts have made community cellular very feasible for rural areas using such technologies community cellular networks can be built in rural area networks in a doityourself diy bottomup fashion in contrast to a traditional gsm macrocell for rural areas which can cost around 500000 usd heimerl et al 67 have shown a complete deployment of functional 2g community base station in rural papua indonesia at a much cheaper price of around 10000 usd the study showed that 187 subscribers were served with a cheap 10000 usd base station thereby providing 830 dollars as monthly revenue with 368 dollars as profit the gsm band for the project was not purchased due to high spectrum cost and the cell was operating in conjunction with the government officials this nonavailability of legal spectrum can be tackled by exploiting the gsm whitespaces discussed in 68 it can be anticipated that recent approximate computing hardware advances will soon permeate networking solutions particularly with 5g appliances becoming virtualized and running as software appliances on cloud data centers with the increased adoption of cloud computing and nfv the neural processing unit npu is a prominent example of new approximate computing hardware which can provide significant benefits such as an average speedup and energy savings of 23 and 3respectively with relatively few errors npus have been shown to provide these gains on almost all type of program applications including signal processing image processing machine learning graphics and gaming 31 has tested the gains of npus on these applications including fast fourier transform which is the one of the most important task of multicarrier communication such as ofdm huawei also recently announced kirin 970 a smart phone processor featuring a dedicated npu for superior performance and efficiency 69 with the current developments in approximate computing and the diverse use cases of npus the time is right to apply these concepts to the development of network hardware such as routers switches network interface cards nics as well as to rf components digital and analog processors and the various hardware blocks of rans further studies considering the affects of area and power efficient approximate hardware on cost and efficiency of cellular networks will provide a more detailed overview of the true potential of approximate networking the time is now ripe to design cost efficient accelerated approximate memory and processors considering the demands of cellular systems for example the use of approximate digital blocks to design content addressable memory widely used for packet classification and forwarding in routers and the impact of new errors on system level performance will provide deep insights on the feasibility of approximate networking similarly self organizing networks son proposed for future cellular networks 70 use machine learning algorithms for various selffuture internet 2017 9 94 18 of 23 organization phases cost area and power efficient hardware at the cost of 100 percent accuracy are proposed for machine learning and deep learning applications 12 the use cases for sons using approximate hardware can reduce the cost of futuristic cellular systems however a detailed and careful analysis of the resultant performance degradation and cost benefit is necessary to understand the benefits and penalties of approximate networking furthermore the codesign of approximate hardware and software stack can help to extract maximum benefits of approximate networking 5 discussion issues 51 zero rating and net neutrality in recent times the idea that internet access is a human right is gaining increasing traction as shown by a recent global internet survey conducted by the internet society 71 there have been recent efforts that have strived to make basic internet access accessible to everyone one approach that has been adopted is the concept of zerorating through which various mobile companies are offering cheaper or free access to selected websites and applications while the idea at its surface appears noble and harmless it has become controversial due to its relationship with net neutralitythe idea that all content on the internet is equal and should be treated such one way of provisioning an approximate internet experience is to curate a walled garden in such an approach a company or service provider provides access to a limited set of approved sites and services through its platform typically at a reduced rate or even free facebook has adopted the walled garden approach for its free basics program this project has however become controversial with india recently ruling that program and others like it infringe the principles of net neutrality critics of the program have criticized that facebook is violating the tenets of net neutrality project and that such a project leads to an unfair market since in this project a forprofit company facebook adopts a position where it can decide which service qualifies as an essential service whats better approximate or zilch it has been discussed that how users are often willing to tradeoff fidelity for convenience this would seem to imply that users will be happy with accessible approximate networking solutions when conveniently available people are divided over the utility of zero rating with one group asserting that zero rating programs can help as a helpful adhoc arrangement while others argue that these programs create a tiered internet ecosystem that is still not able to bridge the digital divide 72 the net neutrality and zero rating debate is not only a rational debate but also an emotional and moral one in some cases people may prefer no networking service to an approximate networking service research on the experience of users has however shown that while it is true that some access is better than none users are not always thrilled at being limited to a vastly limited subset of the internet 73 to understand why users may turn something for nothing it is instructive to refer to the classical gametheoretic ultimatum game in this game the first player receives a sum of money and proposes a sharing offer to the second player the second player can either choose to accept or reject this offer if the second player accepts the money is split as proposed otherwise neither player gets anything under rational economic theory assumptions the second player should accept any offer since something is better than nothing in utility however a number of experiments have shown that typically the responder will not accept unfair divisions and will deprive the proposer by rejecting the offer in the process losing his money as well this game demonstrates the nuance of the question whats better approximate or none notwithstanding the problems that current zerorated approaches are facing we believe that the goal of democraticizing internet service is worthwhile researchers agree that more research is needed to fully access the impact of specific zero rating initiatives as well as the potential impact of zero rating more generally on internet adoption in the developing world and in rural and lowincome regions 72 in particular more research is required to study user preferences regarding limited accessfuture internet 2017 9 94 19 of 23 to the complete internet vs unlimited access to an incomplete internet while facebooks free basics is probably not the right solution it may be the case that betterdesigned good enough solutions offered at a convenient and affordable price will disrupt the currently established markets 52 hci issues user perceptions of the approximation previous humancomputerinteraction hci research has shown that humans subjective knowledge can be flawed relatively fast service may be judged to be unacceptable unless it is also predictable visually appealing and reliable 74 more research is needed on which kinds of weaknesses are most perceived by users this knowledge can then be used to determine the precise approximate networking tradeoff to adopt so that the users perceive least inconvenience if it turns out that the pareto principle or the 8020 rule is applicable then we can optimize for the approximation that is responsible for 80 of user perceived qos in view of the users experience high network latency has an obvious detrimental effect on latencybound applications such as gaming voice and web applications while bandwidth is admittedly important for qos especially for bulk transfer and video applications it turns out that the roundtriptime rtt can dominate performance more than bandwidth for short bursty http connections 75 especially over longdistance widearea networks wans 76 it has been shown in humancomputer interaction hci literature that increments of only 100 ms can decrease sales by 1 and human can sense and do react to small differences in the delays of operations 50 6 conclusions the utopian goal of providing ideal networking service universally is an elusive target due to the moving target nature of ideal networking and the lack of affordability of advanced technologies in challenging markets a lot of experience has highlighted the fidelityconvenience tradeoff which is seen when users are willing to tradeoff considerable fidelity for convenience in terms of accessibility and affordability in this paper we have described approximate networking as a philosophy that understands that there will no onesizefitsall ideal networking solution that will be universally applicableapproximation networking proposes to adopt appropriate contextspecific tradeoffs to provide goodenough service in addition we have also provided an overview of approximate networking technologies and have highlighted how a number of existing internet technologies can be seen as instances of the larger approximation networking vision approximate networking as envisioned in this paper is a powerful abstraction that has significant promise for global access to the internet for all gaia realizing approximate networking will require multidisciplinary research in diverse domains such as algorithms protocols operating systems and hardware architectures we believe that approximate networking can provide a novel fundamental tuning knob that can facilitate contextappropriate tradeoffs by adopting the extra degreeoffreedom of approximate computing at the hardware level that can help realize the egalitarian vision of gaia author contributions all authors

with this exponential growth in network traffic volume and inception of many datahungry communication applications network traffic classification becomes a very challenging problem for users and service providers classical network traffic classification techniques are based on port and payload inspection but these schemes have their shortcomings in terms of dealing with a large amount of data and different types of network traffic recent advances in machine learning ml such as deep learning dl techniques have produced exceptional results in many application domains including computer vision natural language processing speech recognition and system control dl is a branch of mltechniques where a hierarchical structure of neural network layers is used to autonomously learn the features and then those learned features are used for classification or prediction the success of mldl in multiple application domains has motivated the networking community to explore the potential benefits of these techniques for building an autonomous control for improving the per formance of networking applications such as network traffic classification anomaly and intrusion detection in the last few years many mldl based networking solutions have been proposed highlighting the applications and challenges of using ml techniques in the networking domain 7 9 14 30 31 recently mldl techniques were found to be vulnerable to carefully crafted perturbations in the test examples theseexamples are known as adversarial ml examples adversarial examples force the mldl algorithm to malfunction and produce incorrect results dl schemes especially deep neural networks dnn are function approximators that have an associated generalization error which makes them vulnerable to adversarial ml attacks adversarial ml attacks can be divided into two broader categories based on the adversarys knowledge namely whitebox adversarial attacks ie per fect knowledge and blackbox adversarial attacks ie real world settings in this paper we take network traffic classification as a functional proxy for mldl based autonomous networking applications and propose a blackbox adversarial ml attack on network traffic classification although the focus of our paper is on network traffic classification our findings are broadly applicable to similar settings that involve other applications of mldl to realize autonomous networks the purpose of our proposed attack is to compromise the integrity of network traf fic classification to shed light on the risks involved in utilizing mldl techniques in support of networking applications our results indicate that the current state of the art mldl based network traffic classification algorithms do not pro vide substantial deterrence against adversarial ml attacks our experiments utilize the highly cited tornontor dataset provided by habibi et al 18 to perform the proposed black box adversarial ml attack on tornontor traffic classifier to demonstrate that using current mldl techniques to realize autonomous networks can be a potential security risk contributions the contributions of this work are twofold propose and validate a blackbox adversarial ml attack on network traffic classification tornontor classifica tion to the best of our knowledge this is the first blackbox adversarial ml attack on network

classification tor 8 is a low latency anonymity preserving system that is based on overlay network that anonymizes the traffic of tcp based applications it is also known as onion routing tech nique for traffic anonymization in tor messages are encrypted and transmitted through distributed onion routers where each router uses a symmetric key to decrypt the messages and learn the routing details ie next onion router the same process goes on in each router and this process obscures the actual transmitter from the users perspective tor provides security and privacy whereas from service providers perspective detection and classification of the tor traffic becomes a very difficult challenge 26 tor traffic classification is a key component of networking architecture it is expected and experimentally validated that deep ml techniques outperform classical tor traffic classi fication algorithms alsabah et al 2 used a decision tree bayesian networks and naive bayes techniques for classifying tor network traffic into two classes namely interactive traffic eg browsing and bulk traffic eg torrent downloading the purpose of their classification was to improve the quality of service qos of the tor network in their twoway classi fication experiments they managed to achieve 95 accuracy and 75 improvement in tor responsiveness ling et al 19 proposed torward a malware

classifies the tor traffic into four categories namely p2p ftp im and web with 92 accuracy unsupervised ml learning schemes such as gravitational clustering have been used for tor traffic classification and the results were compared with classic clustering schemes in 25 hodo et al 15 used artificial neural networks anns and support vector machines svms for binary classification of the

networking domain we first review their applications and effects in other domains deep ml tech niques especially dnns were demonstrated to produce the best classification results in many application domains but they also learn counterintuitive and uninterpretable properties due to discontinuity in the learning process and generalization error 27 these counterintuitive properties can be exploited to form adversarial attacks that deteriorate the performance of dnn based classifiers goodfellow et al 11 proposed an adversarial perturbation generation method to fool dnn based classifiers called fastgradient sign method fgsm in fgsm an adversarial perturbation is calculated by computing the gradient of the cost function with respect to the input itself an extension of fgsm is proposed in 17 where fgsm was iteratively applied with a smaller step size to fool the dnn this method is known as the basic iterative method papernot et al 23 proposed a forward derivative based approach for

the classifier transferability of adversarial ml examples such as logistic regression and svm has been studied in 22 where it is highlighted that svm is less prone to adversarial perturbation due to its training specificity and decision boundary learning process more details about adversarial ml attacks are described in 1 3 20 adversarial attacks on network traffic classification have not yet been covered duly in literature we will cover some general networking applications where basic adversarial ml research has been conducted in our previous work we have used fgsm bim and jsma based attacks to highlight the vulnera bility of using ml in cognitive selforganizing networks under whitebox settings ie the adversary knows details about training data training process and model

deep ml based tor traffic classification which is used as a proxy 85to represent other network functional areas to the best of our knowledge no standardized deep mlbased tor traffic classification method has been proposed yet although as mentioned in section ii neural networks have outperformed other mldl techniques for tor traffic classification we utilize both dnns and svm for tortraffic classification we utilize the mutual information mi for crafting adversarial perturbations and substitute model training to perform the blackbox adversarial attack before discussing the design of the deep ml classifier and the adversarial attack we describe the threat model and related assumptions a threat model in this subsection we delineate the threat model assump tions table i provides a summary of the notation used in our blackbox attack procedure 1 adversary knowledge the proposed attack in this paper only considers blackbox adversarial ml attack model where the adversary has no knowledge of training data number of layers in the model training hyperparameters type of layers and training data the adversary can only access the output of the deep ml model ie dnn in this case in a query response manner the adversary can send an input to the model and collect the label as a response these queryresponse pairs are later used for crafting an adversarial attack we assume that the adversary can only perform an adversarial attack during the test time other attacks such as poisoning attacks are not within the scope of this study 2 adversarial goals the goal of the adversary is to compromise the integrity and availability of the tor traffic classifier by minimally altering the test examples in adver sarial attacks on computer vision and natural language pro cessing applications the fundamental restriction on adversarial examples is to preserve the visual representation or semantic meaning of the image or text respectively this restriction is replaced with a more difficult one in the context of networking where the adversary has to ensure that the applied adversarial perturbation does not affect the functional behavior of the network traffic b tor classification model in this work we use dnn and svm for tor traffic classification svm is a well known ml technique used for classification and regression whereas dnns are wellknown for being capable of solving complex classification tasks by extracting hierarchical representation from their input dnn consists of multiple layers of neurons smallest computational unit each layers output is the input of the next layer the nonlinear activation function is used to ensure that each neuron also learns nonlinear information the output layer of the dnn uses softmax as activation function to produce the classification probability vector we use the dnn and svm classifiers for binary and multi class classification where binary classification is performed between tor and nontor traffic and multiclass classification is performed between different tor traffic classes we used stochastic gradient descent with a batch size of 100 for training the classifier we used a 7030 ratio of the data figure 1 steps for designing a blackbox adversarial attack on network traffic classification processes through synthetic data generation substitute model generation and adversarial sample crafting for training and validation purposes we achieved 96 and 9354 accuracy for binary class classification using dnn and svm respectively for multiclass classification we achieved 9060 and 8060 accuracy using dnn and svm respec tively classification accuracy of both models can be improved by carefully choosing hyperparameters for dnn training c blackbox attack procedure in this subsection we delineate the procedure used to per form the blackbox adversarial ml attack on tor traffic classi fication models the proposed adversarial attack is performed in two steps namely substitute model training andadversarial sample

architecture s the goal in training sis to mimic the decision boundary of the deployed classifier f this process is divided into two components namely substitute model architecture design synthetic dataset collection and substitute dnn training on synthetic dataset substitute model architecture design and synthetic dataset collection are very challenging tasks since the adversary has no information about fs architecture and training process selection of appropriate architecture for sand training pro cedures are performed heuristically in our experiments we selected dnn as our substitute architecture the adversarial attack proposed in this paper is also applicable to other mldl architectures with some modifications to the training process the adversary can also train multiple mldl models to find the besttrained substitute model sapprox substitute model sis trained using synthetic data samples qprepared by querying ffor labelsy we used a moderate number of queries

results from applying our methods in the operators network for online jammer detection we also present promising results on pinpointing jammer locations when our methods spot jammer activity in the network along with cell site location data i introduction jamming is the intentional interference aimed at disrupting wireless communications services and as such can be seen as a denial of service dos attack 1 2 the use and sale of jamming devices commonly referred to as jammers is therefore illegal in many countries eg 3 4 and any violations may result in imprisonment or fines eg 5 6 nevertheless jammers targeting all wireless communications technologies continue to be widely available and in fact quite affordable see 79 for example the threat posed by jammers to robust wireless communications including on mobile networks is expected to become worse in the future with lowcost and opensource softwaredefined radio sdr platforms becoming easily available to arm malicious actors 1012 in this paper we consider jamming in operational mobile networks and in particular focus on the problem of detecting jammer activity in this context the activation of jammers can severely deteriorate the service quality in a mobile network fig 1 shows the impact on selected celllevel key performance indicators kpis due to the presence of a jammer using data from an operational 4g network we observe that the jammer activation effectively shuts down the network for users forcing uplink ul and downlink dl traffic volumes and throughputs down to nearzero the levels of received signalstrength indicator rssi can also be elevated by over 20db 100x increase with a jammer these results highlight the potential risk posed by jammers to the robustness of mobile networks this applies not just to currently deployed 3g and 4g networks that the society heavily relies on for personal mobile communications emergency response systems and public safety networks but also for future 5g networks that aspire to support diverse use cases including ultrareliable and lowlatency communications services eg connected vehicles remote surgery the jammer detection in current practice however is a highly manual process that is costly and slow resulting in degradation in user quality of experience qoe while the jammer induced interference is detected and resolved when significant service quality deterioration or network outage is noticed which may be prompted by user reporting radio network engineers manually examine large volumes of multidimensional network kpi data to diagnose the problem which may also require field testing moreover when jammer activity is intermittent it can be perceived as a radio network problem and result in misguided network reconfigurationsoptimizations thus in current operational mobile networks according to the operators themselves it may take days or weeks after the jammer activation for it to be detected this suggests that jammer detection is a perfect use case for automation in mobile networks that can not only lead to savings in operating expenditure opex costs for operators but also enhance user qoe jammer detection is also the first step that can enable further troubleshooting to identify and pinpoint the interference source in view of the above we aim at automated jammer detection for operational mobile networks that can automatically and quickly detect jammer deactivations then trigger alarms to kickstart downstream resolution processes while this clearly involves reliable detection of all kinds of malicious jammers we also aim to detect the operation of other unintentional interference sources eg malfunctioning devices dect phones that can cause jammerlike impact on the network achieving this goal however is hard as it requires addressing the following challenges 1any available groundtruth label information on jammer activations to build an automated detection

complex discontinuous activation patterns they also differ from each other in their type eg military drone specific jammer dect phone the networks eg 3g 4g and frequency bands they target in our realworld dataset we have encountered jammers that can affect as many as ten different frequency bands moreover newer types of jammers with a priori unknown characteristics can emerge over time 3jammer related activity needs to be disambiguated from network kpi dynamics induced from normal and expected behavior eg due to user mobility network overload but this can be challenging for example with active but distant jammers to this end we present jade which to the best of our knowledge is the first automated jammer detection framework for operational mobile networks by treating jammer activity as abnormal or anomalous from the mobile radio access network ran infrastructure side jade approaches jammer detection as an anomaly detection problem 1315 jade is envisioned for operator side deployment and considers cells at each tower site as measurement vantage points it continually monitors the time series of various kpis at each of these cells to detect anomalous behavior over time at the core of jade are two deep learning based time series anomaly detection methods that we developed they work with multivariate kpi data at each cell in the first method a multivariate long short term memory lstm neural network model tracks the variation of uplink rssi observed at each cell to predict its future value and detects an anomaly jammer activation when the difference between the predicted and the actual value is more than a threshold the second method models multivariate kpi time series using a lstm autoencoder model and the associated reconstruction error over time is compared against a threshold to detect jammer activation to address the several challenges outlined above ie limited labeled data ability to detect new and a priori unknown jammer activity discrimination of jammer activity from normal kpi dynamics jade operates in a semisupervised anomaly detection mode 13 in that it relies only on normal datafor training the above outlined models this jammer agnostic nature of jade also makes it robust for detecting jammers that may exhibit adversarial behaviors jade also embeds a mechanism to adaptively set thresholds to detect anomalies thereby adjust the boundary between normal and abnormal events to efficiently support the detection of jammers at scale in realworld mobile networks across multiple cells and operating frequency bands we employ transfer learning 16 to develop one frequency and cell agnostic model instead of a different model for each cell and frequency band in summary we make the following key contributions we propose jade a novel datadriven jammer activity detection framework for operational mobile networks iii which addresses this problem for the first time it incorporates two alternative customtailored semi supervised deep learning based anomaly detection methods for the jammer detection task along with an adaptive thresholding mechanism jade also leverages transfer learning towards efficient modeling and ease of deployability we extensively evaluate the jade framework using a 4g radio access network ran dataset from a multinational mobile network operator iv our results show that the anomaly

j16 j17 and j22 among these j16 affects three frequency bands mhz mhz 2500 2520 mhz and has a discontinuous onoff activation pattern on the other hand j17 and j22 have continuous activation patterns which means once activated they stay active until they are switched off j17 and j22 operate on 25002520 mhz and mhz bands respectively all these three sub datasets are manually labeled by radio

methods considered in this paper overall the testing dataset consists of 255600 samples with groundtruth annotated kpi data kpis captured in each sample are same as in the training dataset each of the three subdatasets contain data for at least 50 cells for the above datasets we have conducted preprocessing steps to impute missing values with the average of neighboring values and normalized each kpi value via minmax normalization we did further feature extraction based on the timeseries of the above listed kpis following a similar methodology to the one in 17 which led to 82 features in all besides the datasets described above the proposed jade framework and constituent jammer detection methods are validated through trials on the operator side in ivc we present results for two additional different jammers labeled j23 and j19 encountered during the field trial period in the case study on jammer localization based on jammer detection events ivd we also use the groundtruth location data

groundtruth falsepositive fp jammer activity detected when in fact there is no jammer activity truenegative tn jammer activity not detected when jammer activity is absent as per the groundtruth falsenegative fn jammer activity not detected even though jammer is actually active an effective jammer detection method minimizes both fps and fns two commonly used measures to assess the extent to which a given method achieves these goals are precision andrecall1 as defined below precision tp tp fp1 recall tp tp fn2 higher values for both these metrics are desired a lower value of precision equivalently a higher number of fps leads to an increase in opex to diagnose confirm and localize jammer activity eg by field visits and testing when in reality there is none on the other hand a lower value of recall equivalently a high number of fns shows that the method in question fails to detect all jammer activation events and thus risks prolonged degradation of user qoe until the jammer activity is eventually detected and stopped given the above having high precision and high recall are equally important as such we consider a composite metric called f1score that weighs precision and

shown in fig 2 we find that the average uplink rssi is the most important feature followed by uldl traffic volumes and throughputs interestingly the percentage of volte drops has the least predictive effect on the classifier perhaps because call drops could happen due to a myriad of factors beyond the jammer presence eg due to network overload or coverage issues fig 3 shows the box plot results for precision recall and f1 score metrics separately for each frequency band where the j16 jammer operates with each box plot capturing the distribution for the metric across different cells we observe that precision and recall values are less than ideal and range between 07 08 and 055075 respectively the relatively lower recall results indicate that this supervised classifier method errs more towards missing some jammer activation events than causing false alarms the combined effect measured by f1score is worse with a median value between 05 and 07 crucially this poor classification performance is noticed for cases with fewer cells and less data in the training dataset this highlights a key issue with supervised classification based approach to jammer detection more and diverse labeled data is needed compared to getting normal class data it is difficult and very costly to produce a large and diverse labeled dataset with jammer activation events more data can be available for normal periods as reflected by our datasets where 700000 samples or at least 70 of the total data is for the normal category but supervised classifiers fail to take advantage of such data fig 3 precision recall and f1score performance of random forests based supervised binary classifier b jade overview the foregoing discussion not only highlights limitations with the supervised classification based approach but a key challenge to be addressed in jammer detection method design ie limited or no data labeled with jammer effect another challenge is that there exist numerous types of jammers and each has its own different characteristics and impact on mobile network performance eg due to affecting different sets of frequency bands gathering training data that represents all jammer types is simply impractical moreover identifying the decision boundary between normal network behavior and that affected by jammer activity through the radio network kpis is challenging due to the inherent kpi dynamics our proposed jade framework illustrated in fig 4 addressestheabovechallengesjadeisenvisionedforoperator side deployment and considers cells at each tower site as measurement vantage points to aid in online jammer detection it relies on continual monitoring of time series of various kpis at each of these cells and collecting this data at the operator randatalakefacilitythisdataisthenpreprocessedtoaddress issues such as missing values by imputing with neighboring ones before putting it through the jammer detection pipeline in jade jade approaches jammer detection in an operational mobile network as a timeseries anomaly detection problem 1315 by considering that jammer activity manifests as abnormal or anomalous in the time series of radio network kpis to address the aforementioned challenges jade adopts the semisupervised form of anomaly detection 13 by solely relying on and leveraging potentially abundant normal data for model training this also makes jade independent of the type and behavior of a jammer thereby enabling robust detection across diverse types of jammers at the core of jade are two alternative deep learning based anomaly detection models besides jade incorporates an adaptive mechanism for these models to set thresholds that represent the boundary between normal and anomalous samples also rather than have a separate anomaly jammer detection model per cell or frequency band jade employs transfer learning 16 towards onecell and frequency band agnostic model we elaborate on the above components of jade in the following subsections c deep learning models for celllevel anomaly detection here we describe the two anomaly detection based models we develop as part of jade for jammer activity detection 1142authorized licensed use limited to national university fast downloaded on april 302024 at 052003 utc from ieee xplore restrictions apply fig 4 illustration of the jade framework 1 autoencoder ae 25 based model 2 rssi prediction based model both these models operate at the cell level and take multivariate time series data for radio network kpis as input but aim to detect anomalous samples in the time series through different approaches as elaborated below since we are dealing with timeseries data we use lstm 26 cells in the architecture of both models 1autoencoder ae based anomaly detection model fig 5a illustrates the proposed lstm autoencoder based model that takes multivariate time series as input the core idea is to encode each input sample using an lstm network and decode it using another lstm network anomaly detection relies on the inability to faithfully decode the input sample with a sufficient amount of training data ie normal samples the ae model learns to reconstruct the normal samples the reconstruction error for normal samples will therefore be lower compared to the reconstruction error of samples in the presence of a jammer as mentioned above the ae model has two components an encoder and a decoder the encoder represents the input sample in the latent space whereas the decoder aims to reconstructs the latent domain back to the input sample the encoder in our model consists of four layers the number of lstm cells in the first layer is equal to the number of features in the input sample while the following three layers have 512 64 and 4 lstm cells respectively then the decoder reconstructs the input sample from the 4dimensional latent space the decoder also consists of four layers where the number of lstm cells in its first three layers are 4 64 and 512 respectively the number of lstm cells in the last layer of the decoder equals the input sample size in terms of features to the ae model we use mean squared error mse as a loss function and trained the model for 20 epochs for every cell in the training dataset we empirically optimize the hyperparameters with grid search 24 we use rmsprop as an optimizer and relu as an activation function with a batch size of 64 since the network kpis have inherent noise and variations we did not introduce any additional noise in the input of the ae towards better generalization 2rssi prediction based anomaly detection model we now present an alternative anomaly detection model for jammer activity detection that focuses on predicting the uplink rssi over time considering that this kpi is seen to be the most fig 5 a autoencoder based anomaly detection model b rssi prediction based anomaly detection model important feature in our earlier study on supervised binary classification based jammer detection fig 2 the essential idea here is to train a timeseries prediction model that takes as input multivariate time series of kpis and predicts the rssi for each following time step the prediction error is expected to be low for normal samples as the model is trained with data consisting of such samples but the presence of jammer activity can yield higher prediction errors which can then be identified as anomalies jammer activation events fig 5b illustrates our rssi prediction based anomaly detection model which leverages the stateoftheart lstm based time series prediction model architecture our model consists of four lstm layers the input layer three hidden lstm layers and one fully connected output layer the lstm cells in the input layer are equal to the number of features in each input sample the following three hidden layers have 32 16 and 8 lstm cells respectively the output layer is a fully connected dense layer with a single neuron that outputs rssi predictions specifically our model predicts the rssi for the following 10 time steps based on multivariate kpi time series for the past 10 time steps along a moving window like in the ae model the hyperparameters are experimentally optimized with grid search relu is used as an activation function and the batch size is 64 3 single and multikpi models we consider two variants of the above described models single kpi model that considers only one kpi specifically rssi in essence ae and rssi prediction versions of this model deal with rssi kpi time series note that each sample in the input time series to these models is multivariate with 74 different features due to feature extraction during data preprocessing multikpi model that considers all 9 kpis in our dataset including other kpis like uplinkdownlink throughput and rach success rate this is naturally a multivariate time series with 82 features in each sample of the input time series again due to the feature extraction step these single and multikpi models allow us to understand the added benefit of considering the various different kpis beyond just the uplink rssi d adaptive thresholding the two anomaly detection models described in the previous subsection produce a reconstructionprediction error for each new sample in a cell kpi time series but to detect whether that sample is an anomaly due to jammer activity or other such 1143authorized licensed use limited to national university fast downloaded on april 302024 at 052003 utc from ieee xplore restrictions apply fig 6 representative result showing the performance gain with our grubbs test based adaptive thresholding approach compared to the stateoftheart napproach interference we need a threshold error level representing the boundary between normal and anomalous samples correctly setting this threshold is equally key to effective jammer detection it can be seen as deciding the tradeoff between fp and fn probabilities different approaches are taken for this thresholding in the literature some works do this manually relying on human expert feedback to setadapt thresholds eg 2729 but this is unviable in our setting feng et al 30 simply use the median reconstruction error as the threshold which is again not robust most recent wireless anomaly detection works however approachthisthresholdingbyassumingthaterrorsaregenerated from a gaussian distribution some of these works 3133 set the threshold based on a desired fp probability which is not appropriate in our setting as we also would like to have equally good precision and recall performance other works 3436 adopt a nthresholding approach for some small value of nwhere is the standard deviation of the error distribution this essentially means that a sample is considered an anomaly if its error reconstructionprediction error in our case is more than naway from the mean of the error distribution obtained using normal training data while the reconstructionprediction errors across all samples in the training data also follow a gaussian distribution in our case results not shown due to space limit we find the nthresholding approach is not robust in our setting as we show shortly we observe that this is because of the diversity among cells and so the impact of a jammer on those cells is also different there also exist other works eg 37 that empirically obtain a fixed threshold we instead take a tailored adaptive thresholding approach on a per cell basis by examining the time series of reconstructionprediction errors in each cell to detect anomalies our proposed approach to this issue can be seen as an adaptation of grubbs test 38 for single outlier detection in univariate data note that the data for thresholding purposes refers to either reconstruction or prediction errors depending on the anomaly detection model used and it is therefore univariate in the following we describe our proposed thresholding method we start by defining two hypotheses h0 there are no outliers in the data and h1 there is exactly one outlier in the data we also define grubbs test statistic to be calculated fig 7 average rssi distribution across cells using different uplink frequency bands for each new data error sample yi gcalc maxy iy s4 where yands respectively represent the mean and standard deviation of the error data samples considered for outlier detection based on the above we detect an outlier yi or equivalently reject the null hypothesis h0hypothesis of no outliers if the calculated test statistic is greater than a

on the j16 ul mhz test dataset e transfer learning our proposed solution for detecting jammer activity via anomaly detection model with adaptive thresholding approach thus far implicitly considered a single cell scenario in practice however each cell tower site hosts multiple cells possibly configured on different frequency bands moreover an operators network deployment may have thousands of such cell sites but training and maintaining a per cell or even per frequency band anomaly detection models is not scalable from a deployment perspective we therefore aim at a single cell and frequency agnostic anomaly detection model one per each alternative discussed in iiic we cannot however base such a model by training it on single cell or even single frequency band as different cells and frequency bands have diverse behavior in terms of radio network kpis and jammer effect for example the rssi distributions across cells on different uplink frequency bands shown in fig 7 clearly highlight such diversity so we train our target cell and frequency agnostic model using normal data from different cells and frequency bands to make this training efficient we leverage transfer learning tl 16 specifically we train the cell and frequency agnostic model as follows we start with a frequency band and a cell within that band once the model is trained with data for that cell we treat that as the start point for training on a different cell from the same frequency band reusing the already trained models weights as opposed to starting from scratch once the model is trained across all cells of a frequency band then it is used as the base model for training on cells for another frequency band we repeat this process until we cover all frequency bands and cells in the training data which ultimately results in the frequency and cell agnostic model iv evaluation in this section we evaluate the performance of the proposed jade framework using the operator provided 4g ran datasets described in iiain terms of the precision recall and f1score metrics defined in iib a comparative evaluation of anomaly detection methods in the previous section we have already presented evaluation results that show the effectiveness of the adaptive thresholding mechanism in jade here we evaluate the different anomaly fig 9 performance of baseline ad methods on the j16 ul mhz test dataset detection ad model alternatives in jade relative to commonly used ad methods 13 39 recall from iiicthat the jade framework offers four different ad models ae and rssi prediction based models each with single and multikpi versions we train these models using the training dataset iia we evaluate using the j16 ul mhz part of the testing dataset for comparison we consider five diverse and commonly used ad methods zscore local outlier factor oneclass svm robust covariance and isolation forest to make these baseline methods work with our multidimensional kpi data we use principal component analysis pca 40 based dimensionality reduction to represent the dataset in twodimensional space fig 8 shows the performance comparison between the four jadead modelswe observe that themultikpi version ofae based ad model performs worse than the other three models especially in terms of recall however the single kpi version specifically rssi of the ae model relatively performs much better we attribute this to the characteristics of kpis other than rssi that allow reconstruction even in jammer presence resulting in some jammer activations going undetected rssi prediction based ad models both perform well with higher than 09 values in all three metrics the multikpi version of rssi prediction based model offers the best performance overall which suggests that considering all kpis is beneficial although marginally relatively the baseline methods perform quite poorly with values for all metrics less than 06 which is no better than the random guess based on the known probability of jammer activation events in the test dataset as prior fig 9 these results provide a convincing justification for developing tailored ad methods for kpi based jammer detection as we do in jade b robustness across diverse frequencies jammer types so far we have considered the jade performance on one uplink frequency band j16 ul1800 and with jammer type j16 here we evaluate across different frequency bands and jammer types to assess its robustness for this study we consider the best performing model from the previous experiment as the jade ad model the multikpi version of rssi prediction based ad model we first compare the jammer detection performance between frequencyspecific and frequencyagnostic versions of the chosen jade ad model on different frequencies that

multikpi rssi prediction based ad model jammer operates on the frequencyagnostic version is obtained with tl based training as described in iiie results shown in fig 10 indicate that the frequencyagnostic model though marginallyworsethanitsfrequencyspecificcounterpartsyields greater than 09 value for all metrics in more than 90 of the cells the training time from using tl relative to not using it is shown in fig 11 which clearly demonstrates the training efficiency gain that tl provides to study robustness of jade jammer detection performance we apply the tl based frequencyagnostic model as in the previous experiment on j17 and j22 parts of the testing dataset results shown in fig 12 clearly confirm the effectiveness of jade for these other jammer types the root of the robustness property of jade lies in its design choice to rely on semisupervised form of anomaly detection training only on normal data c field validation so far our evaluation of jade performance was based on operator provided data labeled with groundtruth on jammer activity ie the testing dataset in iia we now present results validating jade performance in the field at the operator side for this purpose we provided the radio network engineers at the operator with the implementation of jades tl based frequencyagnostic ad model as in the last experiment it was used to reliably detect a different type of jammer j23 with discontinuous activation pattern as shown in fig 13 jade was also used at the operator side to detect a military grade jammer j19 targeting different uplink frequencies due to the complex nature of this jammer activity it was not practical like with j23 to manually label the groundtruth by the operators radio engineers nevertheless we visually demonstrate in fig 14 how jade is able to detect jammer activity on a sample cell affected by this jammer during the fig 12 the performance of tl based frequencyagnostic jade ad model on j17 and j22 part of the testing dataset fig 13 operatorside field validation with j23 jammer field trial period jade was also used to detect jammerlike activity that was eventually diagnosed to be due to a hardware related problem see fig 15 which shows the versatility of our jade approach to detect both intentional and unintentional interference behavior affecting mobile network operations d jammer localization case study here we briefly discuss a case study for jade on jammer localizationtheideaistousethejammerdetectionresultswith jade in conjunction with cell site location data to estimate a jammers location jammer localization is a kind of transmitter localization problem as cell sites surrounding a jammer detect its activity with jade as receivers and it can be localized based on sensed signals at those sites as our purpose here is not on jammer localization algorithm design per se but rather on showing the usefulness of jade for such downstream task we consider three most commonly used transmitterlocalizationalgorithms41maxrssicentroidand weighted centroid with max rssi the location of the cell site where jammer is detected with max rssi is taken as jammers location estimate with weighted centroid rssi weighted geometric center of cell site locations that detect the jammer is estimated as the jammer location we use the groundtruth jammer locations provided by the operator to calculate location estimation errors as euclidean distance between groundtruth and estimated locations fig 16a shows the obtained results for j16 j17 and j22 jammers in our testing dataset while fig 16b zooms in on the results for j17 case even with these commonly used localization algorithms we find that jammers can be localized within a few hundred meters of the groundtruth which is sufficient in practice for radio engineers to pinpoint the source of jamming activity between the three jammers considered j16 is located in the country side with sparser mobile network 1146authorized

wireless lans and multihop networks a significant early work 1 considers jamming in sensor networks considering 80211 networks 43 examines local and collaborative detection methods while 44 focus on distinguishing different types of jamming attacks more recent works in this line of research focus on machine learningbased jammer detection 1820 22 45 with most of them taking a supervised classification approach and concluding that the random forest method performs the best closer to our target setting jamming in mobile networks specifically 4glte is considered in 11 46 47 in contrast to our focus on jammer detection in operational mobile networks these works concentrate on highlighting vulnerabilities of the lte system to jamming attacks and proposing mitigation methods 11 also presents a threat assessment of the lte system that identifies the weakest points in its physical phy layer while 46 47 observe that jamming the uplink is more effective for an attacker than the downlink due to the relatively lower transmission power limit for lte ues in the former we are unaware of any previous work that leverages kpi data to detect jammers in mobile networks by treating them as anomalies or otherwise but there exist works in mobile networks and beyond that use kpi data for anomaly detection",

where fixed sub sets of the phy layer parameter combinations are used to en sure collision avoidance the only problem with their technique is that it suffers from the problems associated with a rulebased mechanism ta et al 4 proposed the use of rl for dynamic phy layer transmission parameters selection for lorabased eds they pointed out multiple issues with lorasim for example using perfectly orthogonal spreading factors based on their identified weakness in lorasim they proposed another discrete event simulator named loramab we identify multiple issues with loramab i loramab in terms of its computational complexity is exponentially complex and hence not feasible for a large number of eds ii loramab does not account for the movement of eds which makes it inapplicable in a network consisting of mobile eds such as healthcare smart vehicles etc iii due to a missing specialized objective function eds have the option of choosing any of the available power levels without particularly focusing on saving power as a solution to the abovestated issues we propose an adaptive phy layer transmission parameters selection algorithm based on drl a comparison of our approach loradrl with prior work loramab and lorasim is presented in table iiii p roposed phy l ayer transmission parameters selection algorithm to the best of the authors knowledge there is no drlbased solution available in the literature for phy layer transmission parameter adaption that assures minimalist collisions in a lora based network a problem formulation we model the lora network with a total klora eds in a network and with all eds being within the range of a lorawan gateway the algorithm is centralized with a ddqn being run on the gateway the gateway is not limited in hardware and power resources hence is able to efficiently run a ddqn the whole operation is formulated as a markov decision process mdp where s denotes the state of the environment allocated actions distance from

able to learn a better pdr in case of an environment consisting of mobile lora eds eds in the experimental setup are mobile and they follow the gaussmarkov mobility model an improvement of more than 500 can be seen in the pdr over loramab as the learning is independent of the eds so we propose the training of the model to be done in a simulation the trained model can then be finetuned in a real

reduction in the count of intelligent devices when eds choose a random parameter combination the packets either suffer collisions or they are lost on the other hand if an ed is intelligent the

stateoftheart algorithms only there are two major schemes for handling dense lora networks i by scheduling the transmissions and ii by an efficient selection of phylayer parameters in 2016 kim et al 16 argued that the adaptive data rate control used by the lorawan protocol is inefficient as it doesnt see the congestion in the lora networks to improve this shortcoming kim et al 16 used a linear regression model and showed better performance by reflecting congestion in the adaptive data rate control bor et al 17 proposed a lorasim simulator for experimenting with dense lora networks using different phylayer parameter settings they use fixed subsets of the phylayer parameter combinations to ensure colli sion avoidance the only problem with their technique is that it suffers from the problems associated with a rulebased mechanism ie their technique is based on a fixed system model and is not able to adapt to the environment changes which are normal in real networks slabicki et al 18 proposed an endtoend network simulator called flora for lora networks and also proposed and validated an adaptive data rate scheme for dynamic selection of link parameters for scaleable and efficient network operation they showed their technique to increase the network delivery ratio under stable chan nel conditions while keeping the energy consumption low they showed that the network delivery rate can be further improved using a networkaware approach wherein the link parameters are configured based on the global knowledge of the network they did not consider the collisions among packets which can significantly reduce the packet delivery ratio bianchi et al 19 presented a sequential water filling strategy for assigning spreading factors sfs to all lora nodes their design focused on 1 equalizing the timeonair in the different sf groups 2 balanc ing the spreading factor across multiple gateways 3 keeping into account the channel capture in lora their work showed an improvement of 38 capacity over the adaptive data rate provided by lorawan abdelfadeel et al 20 propose free a finegrained scheduling scheme for reliable and energyefficient data collection in lorawan they propose that instead of transmitting the data as soon as it is generated it is scheduled for fixed time slots which are decided by their algorithm although this eliminates the problem of collisions in lorawan this scheduling solution is not scalable for dense networks as each ed will have to wait for its allocated time slot on the other hand our algorithm helps efficiently transmit the data as soon as it is generated at the ed with minimized collisions this also removes the delay caused by the scheduling scheme proposed by 20 which might be destructive in eds deployed for timecritical applications the lora network community has also utilized drl schemes for automating different tasks such as load bal ancing 21 and resource management 22 aihara et al 23 proposed a qlearning aided resource allocation and environment recognition scheme for lorawan withcsmaca they train different deep neural networks dnns for each lora ed which is resourceintensive our technique is only based on training a single dnn for the whole network also the learning of each of the dnn proposed by 23 is selfish and every dnn only focuses on its own reward while our technique focuses on a joint reward of the system also such schemes cannot be deployed in dense networks owing to the computational requirements techniques like 23 fail when they are tested against adversarial jamming attacks because of the inability to adapt to the changes in the environment farhad et al 24 propose a proactive mobilityaware resource assignment algorithm for lorawan they pro pose to update the values of sf and transmission power value on each uplink communication their algorithm is not based on learning and hence is bound to fail in real environments where the conditions are different from simulation aggarwal and nassipuri 25 propose to allocate dif ferent sf values to the eds present in a small range of the gateway this allocation leads to a better perfor mance of the network by increasing the overall pdr their algorithm requires to explicitly provide an sf allocation ratio for the eds as our algorithm discussed later is based on reinforcement learning it does this automatically and there is no need to explicitly provide an explicit sfallocation ratio an approach similar to 25 has also been proposed by 26 chinchilla et al 27 propose an algorithm for reduc ing the collisions in lora networks their algorithm works by dividing the wireless medium into resource blocks where each research block is based on one sf value and one channel frequency the objective of their algorithm was only to increase the capacity of the network and they did not consider the energy usage in their algorithm furthermore they do not consider the intersf collisions while our algorithm discussed later takes all of these things into consideration ta et al 28 proposed the use of rl for dynamic phylayer transmission parameters selection for lora based eds they pointed out multiple issues with lo rasim for example using perfectly orthogonal spread ing factors based on their identified weakness in lo rasim they proposed another discrete event simulator named loramab they used the multiarmed ban dits technique to solve the collision issue we identify multiple issues with loramab and hence propose our centralized drlbased algorithm as a solution to these issues the identified issues with loramab are listed below 1 loramab is exponentially complex in terms of its computational complexity and hence not fea sible for dense lora networks the convergence time of the algorithm is high and is bound to increase with an increase in the count of eds 2 it does not account for the mobility of eds this makes it inapplicable in a network consisting of mobile eds such as healthcare smart vehiclesaging society and postemergency networks 3 the focus on optimizing power consumption is not done properly due to a missing specialized objec tive function eds have the option of choosing any of the available power levels without particularly focusing on saving power this random choice does not always lead to the optimal power level selection 4 the computations are being performed at the eds without considering the power limitations in the case of batterypowered eds 5 to reduce the complexity of the problem lora mab reduces the action space of individual eds based on their distance from the gateway in case the eds are mobile a change in their position makes the learning suboptimal we refer the reader to 29 and 30 for getting a comprehensive review of the several adaptive resource allocation schemes proposed for lorawan in our previous work 9 we showed that the perfor mance deteriorates in a loramab based system when eds are mobile in this paper we perform further ex periments with loradrl 9 and show the applicability of loradrl to real lora networks furthermore we test the performance of loradrl in case of largescale jamming attacks and show its adaptability to changes in the environment we also show the susceptibility of rulebased techniques against these attacks iii s ystem setup we have previously described the working of our ddqnbased adaptive phylayer parameter selection algorithm for dynamically deployed networks in 9 in this paper we further discuss the complexity and applicability aspects in detail in the following section one of the major problems seen in the previously proposed resource allocation techniques for lorawan is the missing support for real dynamic environments which keep on changing with time furthermore in the experiments section we show that loradrl can sense the performance drop due to frequency jamming and hence can shift the system to the less interfered channels and hence maintain the performance of the network we also show the ineffectiveness of the rulebased system lorasim against such attacks a problem statement lora provides multiple sf values for transmission which lead to different data rates the signals generated using different sf values are partially orthogonal to each other by compromising the data rate the concurrent transmissions can be increased by the use of different sf values and transmission channels the efficient selection of these parameters in dense networks can not only save energy but also increase the capacity of the networkb system model in our proposed scheme we consider a singlegateway lora network containing klora eds uniformly dis tributed over an area of a radius of 4500m with the gateway present in the center the eds can choose to transmit the data using different phylayer parameter combinations over multiple available transmission chan nels we do not limit the sf values for the eds and all the eds are free to use any of the sf values the gateway acts as the agent whose goal is to decide the phylayer parameters for each of the eds it is assumed that a new ed arrives at each timestep and is located at an arbitrary location the normalized count of each of the actions taken until the current step and the approximate distance of the newcoming lora ed is taken as the state of the environment the basic mapping of our algorithm on the workflow of drl has been given in fig 2 the agent takes a specific action choosing a phylayer parameters combi nation for the new lora ed at a timestep and receives a reward based on the achieved packet delivery ratio pdr and powerusage based on that chosen action fig 2 mapping of our problem setup on drl the gateway is considered the agent and the lora network represents the environment we use pdr and energy consumption as our per formance metrics the pdr is defined as the ratio of correctly delivered messages to transmitted messages over a period of time the achievable pdr depends on the position count and behavior of lora eds for experimental purposes we are assuming a lora network consisting of class c devices for training after training our model can be deployed with any class of the lora devices we use the gaussmarkov model for the mobility of the eds this model eliminates the sudden stops and sharp turns encountered in the random walk mobility model by allowing past velocities and directions to influence future velocities and directions our previous results 9 showed that when the mo bility was introduced in the loramab system 28 the performance started to degrade immediately due to nonadaptability and no support for mobile eds the learning in loradrl is performed on the gateway which is independent of the eds and hence can handle the mobility of eds as far as state calculation is concerned our states are based on the actions taken by the agent until the current step and the approximate distance of the ed from the gateway the former one can be easily calculated by populating a table while the latter can be approximated using the received power ofthe signals from the eds it is to be noted that the eds present near buildings will show less received power than in case of open space this will lead the algorithm to choose higher sf values for such devices which is a good choice the lora devices can support a power level as low as 2 db in case multiple power level choices are included in the actionspace the energy consumption can reduce considerably due to the high trainingconvergence time of loradrl we propose the training of loradrl to be performed in simulation and then the model be de ployed in real networks with the learning to be continued with a small learning rate this will help our proposed model adapt and fit itself to the real environment it is to be noted that we assume that the number of eds and packet arrival rate is known at the gateway it takes around 5 packet transmissions for the gateway to get a reliable estimate of pdr for mobile eds we assume that the current pdr is being averaged with the previous 4 transmissions pdr as we are not assuming very high velocities hence the time required to get a good estimate of pdr is acceptable iv p roposed scheme for adaptive phyl ayer parameter selection a reward function to assist in the learning process we have designed a specialized rewardcost function to optimize phylayer transmission parameters selection for lora eds by using this reward function the maximum reward is given to the optimal combination of phylayer parameters the reward function is given in the below equations equation 3 is the reward for optimizing the pdr of the network only equation 4 is the modified equivalent to include power optimization rt pdred airtimeed 3 rt pdred airtimeed powered4 where poweredpowermaxpowerchosen powermaxpowermin5 ed is the newcoming ed that has arrived in the previous timestep pdr is the package delivery ratio andairtimeedis the airtime of the specific ed in seconds are the relative constants used to assign appropriate weights to pdr airtimeed and powered these constants act as hyperparameters and can be chosen depending on the dynamics of the lora networkpower is the reward based on the power choice for the ed this part of the reward function is designed in such a way that if we have 3 available power levels 3 db 6 db and 12 db the reward is also defined in a distributed fashion in this way more reward say 4xwill be given to the agent if it chooses 3 db power lesser reward 3xwill be given if it chooses the 6 db power and the least reward xwill be given if it chooses the 12 db powerb proposed algorithm the proposed ddqnbased algorithm for learning the phylayer transmission parameters for eds in a lora network has been given in algorithm 1 qnetwork structure is taken as input to the model and it returns a trained ddqn network at the output the algorithm trains for a given number of episodes where each episode is run for timesteps equal to the maximum number of eds present in the system we assume that a new ed arrives at each timestep the replay buffer is populated by the agent by taking different actions at different states samples from this replay buffer are then used to train the neural network this trained network provides the optimal policy for determining the best phylayer parameters for

lora eds are sleeping except when they need to transfer the data the transmissions are carried out on the base of the different transmission classes ie class a b c we propose that the lora ed send the packets to the gateway which in return either sends an acknowledgment to use the previous parameters or sends the new phylayer parameters combination to be used for carrying out further transmissions through the control packets using the fixed bandwidth channel of 125 khz in case the lora ed does not receive the parameters or acknowledgment from the gateway it either chooses the maximum available power and sf to transmit the signal or uses the last allocated phylayer parameters for the transmission this mechanism has also been shown in fig 3 our algorithm also works well on the reduced action space by allowing the agent to choose from a specific subset of actions this reduced subset can be made according to the datarate requirements of different applications by fixing a certain sf cr or transmission channel fig 3 proposed mechanism for implementing our proposed algorithm in real lora networks c drl specifications the neural network is kept small to make the solution more practical a discount factor of 07 has been used to ensure the dependence of the current action on future rewards furthermore we also use the greedy learning procedure to fully explore the statespace where action at timestep tis given as atmaxaqtsa with probability 1 random action with probability 6 we have chosen linear activation at the output layer so that we get a probability for each of the actions in this way if some of the eds can choose only a subset of actions then that ed can choose the action with the maximum probability from that subset of actions the target qnetwork is updated on regular intervals with the weights of the online network",

performance in multichannel scenarios as we know the spreading factors from sf7sf12 are partially orthogonal and transmissions with different sfs can be received on the same channel concurrently similarly the frequency channels are also orthogonal and the same sf can be received on different channels without any interchannel collisions current lora gate ways can receive transmissions from

same time the power of these technologies may be exploited by adversaries for illegal or harmful uses for example deepfakesa portmanteau of the terms deep learning and fakemay be used to produce or alter photorealistic audio visual content with the help of deep learning for an illegal or harmful purpose deepfake technology enables one to effectively synthesize realisticlooking fake audio or video of a real person speaking and performing in any arbitrary way 1 the term deepfake was first coined by a reddit community for synthetically replacing the face of a person with the face of another person the term expanded with time to include similar techniques such as lipsync 2 3 facial expression reenactment 46 fullbody and background manipulation as well as audio synthesis 712 the rise of technology such as deepfake has eroded the traditional confidence in the authenticity of audio and video as b yousaf w sultani and a mahmood are with department of com puter science information

pakistan emails fmuhammadusama junaidqadir gituedupkany digital content audio video text can be easily subverted using advanced deep learning techniques for synthesizing images trained on readily accessible public videos and images 1316 the gravity and urgency of the deepfake threat can be gauged by noting that in recent times a ceo was scammed using deepfake audio for 243000 17 and a fake video of the president of gabon has resulted in a failed coup attempt other potential effects of the deepfake threat include danger to journalism and democratic norms because elections can be manipulated and democratic discourse may be disrupted by creating fake speeches of contending leaders 1 3 unfortunately most of the current research focuses on creating and improving deepfakes and there is a lack of focus on reliable deepfake detection as reported in 16 902 papers on generative adversarial networks gans were uploaded to the arxiv in 2018 but only 25 papers uploaded during the same time period related to the antiforgery related topics recent research shows that neural networks can be used for detecting fake content 1822 these methods however re quire a large amount of fake and real training data to accurately learn the data distributions of both classes the performance of these methods drops significantly on the unseen fake data sampled from a different distribution or generation process as the underlying network may overfit the training data and thereby lose its ability to generalize the model can be further trained to classify previously unseen data but it will require a large amount of data from the new distribution which may not always be available in such problems attackers and defenders are continuously improving their approaches and rolling out new attacks and defenses therefore it may be very difficult to collect a large amount of fake data for new manipulation techniques for such scenarios a fake content detector can detect fake content without even being explicitly trained on it in the current work we propose a twostream network for fake visual content detection the first stream called spatial stream detects the fake data employing rgb images while the second stream dubbed as frequency stream utilizes a combination of discrete fourier transform dft and wavelet transform wt for discriminating fake and real visual content the frequency stream exploits the fact that the distribution of the frequency spectrum of the fake visual data remains distinct from the distribution of the real data frequency spectrum this is illustrated in figure 1 which shows the dft magnitude spectrum for a sample of real and fake images it can be seen that frequency spectrum has patterns that are different from that of real images these differences are used to classify the fake versus real content since the information captured by the frequency stream is different fromarxiv210100676v1 cscv 3 jan 20212 fake real fig 1 dftmagnitude spectrum for fake and real images has discriminative features which can be exploited for improved fake detection performance the information captured by the spatial stream both these streams complement each other and fusing them together can provide better performance and generalization to unseen fake data detection to the best of our knowledge this is the first work that studies the fusion of crossmodal information fusion to improve fake content detection generalization the main contributions of this paper are summarized next 1 a novel twostream architecture for fake visual content detection consisting of a spatial stream ss and a frequency stream fs is proposed the ss learns the difference between the distributions of real and fake visual content in the spatial space using rgb images while the fs learns to discriminate between the distri butions of real and fake content in the frequency do main the coefficients of the stationary frequencies are captured using dft while the coefficients of spatially varying multiscale frequencies are captured using haar wavelet transform the spatial and frequency informa tion complement each other therefore fusion of both has improved fake visual content detection 2 the proposed twostream network comprising of a fre quency and a spatial domain stream has outperformed the stateoftheart fake detection methods with a sig nificant margin a detailed analysis of the proposed approach is performed and we empirically demonstrate that the proposed approach is robust across different quality jpeg compression and blurriness

attributes text body movements and neurological signals and has a broad range of applications across many sectors it helps businesses get a much deeper understanding of their customers enables monitoring of individuals moods in healthcare education or the automotive industry and enables identification of violence and threat in forensics to name a few however aer technology also risks using artificial intelligence ai to interpret sensitive human emotions it can be used for economic and political power and against individual rights human emotions are highly personal and users have justifiable concerns about privacy invasion emotional manipulation and bias in this paper we present the promises and perils of aer applications we discuss the ethical challenges related to the data and aer systems and highlight the prescriptions for prosocial perspectives for future aer applications we hope this work will help ai researchers and developers design prosocial aer applications index

that leverages advances in ar tificial intelligence ai to algorithmically retrieve a per sons emotional state using knowledge from psychology linguistics signal processing and machine learning ml development of aer capabilities can have a transformative effect on society with wideranging implications due to the critical role emotions play in human lives ranging from perception learning and decisionmaking 1 2 3 aer is an umbrella term that encompasses various related terms such as affective computing affect recognition emotional ai or artificial emotional intelligence aei that have been proposed in the literature for automated recognition of human emotions 4 in this paper we use the term aer and focus on human target aer humantargeted aer starts with active or pas sive sensors eg a video camera microphone physiologi cal sensor that mainly captures contextual and behavioural data related to affective facial expressions speech signals body pose gestures gait or physiological signals it is im perative to utilise contextual information while identifying emotions 5 the data obtained through the sensing devices extract emotional cues by the ai systems for categorical or dimensional emotion recognition as depicted in figure 1 email siddiquelatifusqeduau fig 1 an overview of aer systems which can process emotional infor mation from different emotional information sources to predict emotions by utilising different ai techniques aer has evolved over the years and achieved remark able advances however it faces various complex and critical challenges that escalate

ones which can result in inaccuracies and 5 cultural differences in manifesting emotions which makes the problem of developing global aer very difficult the public use of aer services also raises multiple privacy and securityrelated concerns due to the intimate nature that the aer systems detect process recognise and communicate this paper presents promising applications of aer and discusses its various perils in particular we focus on presenting the ethical concerns related to aer systems and databases to highlight the prescriptions for future aer prosocial systems we note here the specificity or universality of human emotions has been a longstanding debate 13 the propo nents of the universality of emotions suggest that emotions can be recognised regardless of the different cultural back grounds while theoretical studies 14 15 on multicultural studies have suggested six basic universal emotions current aer systems do not perform well in multicultural settings the novelty and contributions of our paper are high lighted in table 1 where we compare this paper with the existing articles on aer the article by mohammad et al 10 enlists the ethical challenges for aer and suggests future directions but does not cover aer applications or the challenges related to bias adversarial attacks explain ability etc similarly other articles only focus on modality specific applications 9 or general challenges 7 without focusing on ethical issues in this paper we attempt to present aers promise perils and ethical concerns we also provide prescriptions for designing prosocial aer systems we hope this paper will guide navigating research and ethical implementation choices for anyone who wants to build or use aer for research or commercial purposes the rest of the paper is organised as follows the promise of aer is described in section 2 the various perils of aers are detailed in section 3 the major ethical concerns withaer are discussed in section 4 we elucidate a prospective path to a prosocial future for aer in section 5 the paper is concluded in section 6 2 p romise of aer aer has a wide range of applications in fields such as healthcare

global economic and public health crisis during the covid19 pandemic 19 the pandemic situation impacts people physically mentally and econom ically aer systems can help to analyse and understand emotional responses during such crises affecting mental health studies 20 21 22 show that the negative emo tions among the population increase during the pandemic ie covid19 and people become optimistic over time by adapting to the pandemic in global crisis situations like covid19 aer systems can help measure crosscultural emotional trends to learn the correlation among populations despite the socioeconomic and cultural differences 21 22 education emotions are very crucial in the education systems due to their important role in the cognitive processes respon sible for assimilating and learning new information 23 unfortunately the current education system fails to track students emotions and hidden indicators of their internal feelings thus making it delicate to adapt and keep the communication channel intact it has been found that the identification and monitoring of the learners emotional state greatly facilitates the teacher in taking actions that significantly enhance the tutoring quality and execution and improve studentteacher interactions 24 therefore it is worthwhile to utilise smart systems that can model the relations between emotions cognition and action in the learning context 25 in this regard aer systems can beconsidered by schools to quantify student moods and en gagement in the classroom 26 aer could help to reinforce students attention motivation and selfregulation toward studies it could also help promote effective learning by increasing students interest 25 on the other hand aer systems can improve certain emotional qualities teachers must have to facilitate pedagogical approaches in education 23 safety emotions are directly linked to human problemsolving abilities 27 safety behaviours can be predicted from the individuals ability to manage and process emotions during a time of stress there is ample evidence that negative emotions such as anger fear and anxiety strongly affect hu man behaviour and occupational safety 28 for example emotions can impact workplace safety and health in the workplace the negative mood of a person can contaminate an entire team or group this may damage workplace safety and impair team performance if such behaviours are left unaddressed negative emotions can be a workplace hazard with visible effects on team safety aer systems can provide better solutions to monitor an individuals mood and emo tions in addition these systems can help find workers who might need help in transport aer systems can be utilised to improve the safety of drivers as well as anyone on the road driving occupies a large portion of our daily life and is often associated with the cognitive load that can trigger emotions like anger or stress which can badly impact human health and road safety 29 30 studies 31 32 show that in duced negative emotions like anger can decrease a drivers perceived safety and performance compared to neutral and fearful emotional states aer services are being utilised in automotive environment to monitor the drivers fatigue alertness attention and stress level to improve automotive and industrial safety by avoiding serious accidents 29 mass adoption of aer systems to monitor psychological and physiological parameters can significantly enhance the detection of dangerous situations 24 law enforcement and forensics aer systems are increasingly being used for law enforce ment and forensics where such systems have many pos sible applications in identifying threats of violence and terrorism and detecting lies and fraud 33 in a forensic investigation a lie can arise from denial evasion distortion outright fabrication and concealment by offenders to ap pear nonaccountable for their exertions 34 aer systems can help law enforcement agencies to detect deception or malingering by identifying reliable emotional clues in this way aer systems provide additional aid and insights to lawenforcement agencies while pursuing criminal investi gations 35 aer systems can also help detect and differen tiate between acted and genuine victims 34 25 advertising and retail in marketing one of the best ways to sell products is to engage the customers emotionally companies employ vast resources for affective marketing by maximising user4 engagement with ai they attempt to understand and appeal to the customers interests and emotions 36 in order to gauge a shoppers emotion aer systems use sensing devices installed in hightraffic locations including entrances aisles checkouts etc aer systems detect the emotional responses of individual shoppers which help retailers in making decisions on crucial factors including product pricing packaging branding or shelf placement in this way aer systems help retailers understand how consumers communicate both verbally and nonverbally which may help fuel customers buying decisions emotions highly impact individuals responses to re ceiving marketing messages therefore sending an emo tionally tailored message to the target audience increases the customers attention to the advertisement this helps companies to increase the products appeal and achieve a higher level of brand recall 37 indeed advertisements with emotional content have more potential to be remem bered than those conveying notification 38 26 emotional and social intelligence emotional and social intelligence involves understanding inside oneself observing and interpreting others for cogni tive and emotional empathy and responding constructively in a given situation there is great interest in politics to capture and influence the mood of the overall popula tion or community to understand patterns of emotional contagion 39 emotional and social intelligence can help leaders and decisionmakers pick up emotional cues from a population and handle highly challenging situations social networks are particularly utilised to understand population behaviours 40 27 monitoring and evaluation aer systems are being utilised to screen candidates in interviews 41 and to evaluate and monitor employees fatigue stress happiness and job performance 42 it is widely accepted that emotional intelligence directly influ ences an employees intellectual capital organisational re activity and retentively production employee appeal and ability to provide good customer service 43 aer sys tems can contribute to assess a candidates suitability for a job and measure important traits like dependability and cognitive abilities in particular embedded aer systems enabled through iot can provide finegrained analysis of emotions and sentiments 44 which can be used in various ways for monitoring and evaluations in the military and other defencerelated departments aer systems are par tially used to track how sets of people or

dl models are known to be inscrutable and are also not robust and are vulnerable to bias and poor performance in the face of distribution shifts and adversarial attacks 49 this raises concerns about using the validity of aer services since it is not uncommon to see that even wellintentioned technologies can have negative consequences and how technologies can end up harming rather than benefitting

all classical methods in recognising and understanding human emo tions from facial speech and text inputs these advanced learning techniques have produced effective and efficient results in aer and automated the whole process aer systems are used in the commercial market for understand ing user engagement sentiment analysis attention tracking behaviour understanding etc however these aer systems are also prone to shortcomings and biases in the training and testing data the literature on the shortcomings of traditional and deep ml techniques suggests that data and algorithmic biases can impact

agreement or scrutiny of regulatory organisations which is a serious concern in the domain of technologys social effect bowyer 96 argues that utilising these recognition technologies violates the constitutionally guaranteed right to privacy aer systems not only employ facial recognition technologies but also infer the emotional state and other aspects of the face without consent which is an abuse of power and a blatant violation of the fun damental right to privacy the effectiveness of a security surveillance system is determined by the performance of the facial recognition system and a combination of the algorithms to measure the underlying emotional states and motives from just an image of the face and body these algorithms and facial recognition systems have shown to be biased and

we adopt aer services in daily life we willingly cede some of our decisionmaking power to ai this may un dermine the flourishing of human autonomy with artificial autonomy therefore it is crucial to balance the decision making power delegated to aer agents and that we retain for ourselves aer systems must not impair the freedom of their users so they can live according to their standards and norms for ai to yield any benefits for the human race it must be focused on the autonomy of humans rather than the popular belief of giving more autonomy to machines 107 this argument stems from the classical discussions on whether ai techniques are tools to help improve life by making tasks easier or ai understanding the problems by itself and fixing them without categorically consenting the humans here it is essential to understand what autonomy means autonomy is described as the sense of willingness and a cognitive process of committing to a course of action calvo et al 108 take a closer look at human autonomy and technology under the pretext of ethics they highlight that in 2019 most of the literature around autonomy was focused on machine autonomy whereas now this trend is shifted towards human autonomybased technology design after critical technical and ethical issues with machine autonomy and design of machine autonomy were highlighted aer systems are designed to translate the stateoftheart in human psychology using ai and psycho graphs techniques unfortunately human autonomy and ethical questions such as willingness to interact and adopt are not appropriately addressed abbass 109 and 110 argue that since ai techniques are now being integrated into various aspectsof society it is paramount to prefer humans in the loop or humans on the loopbased algorithms for decision making it will ensure that human autonomy and ethical practices are followed in making critical decisions emotion recognition systems are trained on the data harvested from social media and digital platforms to un derstand and infer emotions andalibi et al 111 surveyed 13 social media users about the fact that the data from social media applications are used for training emotion recognition systems without getting users consent even if consent is taken it is collected through a terms and condition form which is mainly forced and in a legal language that is not userfriendly their results indicate that most of the participants viewed it as scary invasive unethical and a loss of power and human autonomy the paper further recommends that ethical usage be ensured in these critical applications at an individual and societal level gender bias is another ethical quandary in the aer system and using these tools in the field necessitates a gender bias evaluation in emotion recognition systems domnich et al 65 assessed the performance of several ai approaches and showed which kind of networks are employed for certain types of emotions the results of the experiments revealed that specific ai designs are discriminatory with significant differences in performance between males and females in terms of emotion recognition another vertical of this discussion on the autonomyrelated aer system is the categorisation of complex human emotions into a set of classes and then the offering solutionsinterventions based on these categories unfortunately this classification concept has a fundamental weakness since human emotions both as individuals and as social groupings are complicated private unique and occasionally indefinable and reducing these aspects to a data point and using it to tweak the behaviour raises various ethical issues 5 p ath to a prosocial future for aer as motivated in the previous sections aer systems are promising for contributing to social good in a wide variety of applications such as healthcare education safety and law enforcement but at the same time it is beset with several risks and perils which must be addressed qadir et al 112 have stressed the need for a more humane human centred ai that is accountable and have outlined promising directions for achieving accountable humancentred ai in this section we highlight some approaches we can adopt to pave the way for a prosocial future for aer systems 51 better awareness and education the development of aer software is bringing enormous changes to society through data analysis aer technology has the positive effect of revolutionising many areas by solving various existing problems on the other hand aer technologies are twosided which can also cause problems therefore it is crucial to raise awareness among the broader population about aers role in our lives and the use and purchase of aer services this can help to achieve large scale adoption of aer services among the general popula tion and minimise the risk of being negatively profiled by aer technology10 52 auditable aer the auditability of ai describes the possibility of evaluating models algorithms and datasets in terms of operation results and effects it has two parts including technical and ethical the technical part assesses the reliability and accuracy of results however the ethical part apprehends its individual and collective impacts and checks the risks of breaching certain principles including equality or privacy aer systems learn from the data they are exposed to and make decisions using ml algorithms they can develop or even amplify biases and discrimination therefore it is essential to audit and test aer algorithms throughout their life cycle to pinpoint the origin of errors and detect risks to avoid their impact on the lives of individuals and society it will help to systematically probe aer systems uncover biases and avoid undesirable behaviour 53 explainable and interpretable aer a key reason behind the fragility of aer services is the blackbox nature of ml models used for the decision making process these ml models are neither explainable nor their outcomes interpretable to realise the real potential of aer systems it is highly desirable to make them ex plainable in a humanunderstandable way in recent years significant research has been devoted to developing novel methods for explaining and interpreting ml models in the literature different explainable approaches can be broadly classified as whitebox and blackbox explanation methods the whitebox explanation method describes the model by identifying the most critical features that contributed to a specific prediction 113 another method for whitebox ex planation is to compute the predictions gradient concerning individual input samples to discover the predictions rele vant features whitebox explanation mainly provides the modelspecific explanation while the blackbox technique provides local explanations of a model for a prediction 114 explaining ml models and their decision is critical as it is the key enabling factor for building trust and ensuring fairness in decision making this is also important for aer applications where decisions directly impact human life 54 privacy preserving aer in aer services the privacy of the users data is a growing concern mainly when aer is performed on cloud plat forms aer companies gather a large amount of user data to perform emotion analysis the data gathered by these companies is kept forever and the user does mostly not have any or little control over it the images video and voice samples but also textual bits also contain sensitive background information such as faces gender language etc the leakage of this data can be used maliciously without the users consent by an eavesdropping adversary and may cause threatening consequences to peoples lives therefore it is crucial to utilise privacypreserving ai models in aer systems to protect users privacy the methods and tech niques for developing ai systems that ensure privacy falls under the umbrella of privacypreserving ai

principles transparency an entity must describe its policies related to the duration it retains data how the data is used how the government might access the data and the necessary technical specifications to verify accountability full disclosure an entity must receive informed written and specific consent from individuals before enrolling her him or them in an aer database enrolment is the storage of personal data such as voice and face prints to perform emotion recognition or identification personal consent an entity must receive informed written consent from an individual before using the individuals data in a manner that was not men tioned in the existing consent when individuals consent to use an aer system for one purpose an entity must seek consent from that individual for us ing aer technology for another purpose however users should be free to withdraw their consent at11 any time an entity must not use the aer system to determine an individuals colour race religion gender age nationality or disability ethical data sharing individuals data should not be shared or sold without the informed written consent of the individual whose information is being shared or sold data ownership an individual must have the right to access correct and remove his or her data print security and privacy aer data must be kept secure and private by the entity maintaining the data simply defining principles is not sufficient these princi ples should be embedded into practice and operationalised an entity must maintain a system that measures compliance with these principles including an audit trail memorialising the collection use and sharing of information in an aer system the audit trail must include a record of the date location consent verification and provenance of emotional data it must also allow evaluation of the aer algorithm for accuracy this data may also be incorporated in a watermark to ease the ability to audit 6 c onclusions and recommendations this paper discussed the promises and perils of artificial intelligencebased automatic emotion recognition systems we believe aer technology has a wide range of real life applications however we aim to caution aer users and service providers about ethical concerns aer systems have biases that can lead to incorrect results just like any other artificial intelligence ai based intelligent systems we cannot fully rely on aer systems in making deci sions however help from them can be taken to improve the final decision we also must carefully consider aer systems fairness transparency accountability and ethics during their development and applications for this we proposed guidelines for designing future prosocial aer solutions we are summarising below the recommendations for designing such responsible aer systems full examination across various dimensions is re quired for the data used by aer systems expres sions of emotion are variable across different lan guages this variability must be taken into account while designing datasets systems and deployment of aer systems one needs to examine the choice of ai techniques across interpretability concerns privacy energy ef ficiency and data needs ai tends to perform well for individuals who are wellrepresented in the data but fails for others therefore it is crucial to explore inclusive methods to avoid spurious correlations that perpetuate sexism racism and stereotypes aer systems are often trained on static data how ever emotions perceptions and behaviour change over time it is important to incorporate adaptability in aer services for predictions on current data this may include drifting target learning approaches privacy is not only secrecy but also a personal choice applying aer to a mass gathering without personal consent is an invasion of privacy harmful to theindividual and dangerous to society therefore it is important to follow suited privacy principles such as the seven by cavoukian while designing aer systems it is crucial to realise ethical concerns related to privacy manipulation and bias while designing aer systems therefore anonymisation of information at various levels is required the use of aer for fully automated decisionmaking is unsuited aer systems may be utilised for assis tance in decisionmaking aer services should be transparent to all stakeholders these recommendations are primarily for the re searchers engineers educators and developers who build make use of or teach about aer technologies these guide lines will help engender trust with customers and also improve the profitable drive growth of aer technology with all these guidelines in mind we shall be ready to fully benefit and enjoy the many good automatic

for data annotation 16 data annotations are critical for developing ml models capable of uncovering complex patterns in large datasets and pushing the stateoftheart in a particular domain human ex pert annotators bulk annotations semisupervised annotations and crowdsourced annotations are all widely used approaches in practice 17 these strategies have their pros and cons human annotators for example can provide highquality data annotations but are susceptible to challenges such as fairness bias subjectivity high cost and time label drifting annotation fatigue and inconsistency dealing with data ambiguity and scalability bulk annotations are a faster and less expensive technique to create data annotations but they might result in lowerquality annotations semisupervised annotations com bine the benefits of humanexpert annotations with bulk anno tations for data annotation but they are complex to implement and have generalisability and robustness difficulties although crowdsourcing human intelligence to annotate large datasets is the quickest and most costeffective option it can create lowerquality annotations and is more challenging to manage the quality of the annotations recently a few studies have investigated the efficacy of llms i e chatgpt for data annotations the goal of these experiments was to explore the potential of chatgpt for data annotation and to find out whether chatgpt can achieve full emergence in downstream tasks such as classification zhuet al 13 tested the ability of chatgpt to reproduce the humangenerated annotations for five seminal computational social science datasets the datasets include stance detection two datasets hate speech detection sentiment analysis and bot detection their results indicate that chatgpt is capable of annotating the data but its performance varies depending on the nature of the tasks the version of chatgpt and the prompts the average reannotation performance is 609 across all five datasets for the sentiment analysis task the accuracy of chatgpt reannotating the tweets is reported at 649 and for the hate speech task the chatgpt performance has gone down to 571 the authors also provided a prompt template that was used for reannotating the data factchecking is a wellknown way to deal with the misin formation epidemic in computational social science hose et al 18 evaluated the ability of llms specifically chatgpt to assist factcheckers in expediting misinformation detection they used chatgpt as a zeroshot classifier to reannotate 12784 humanannotated true claim false claim fact checked statements chatgpt was able to correctly reannotate 720 of the statements the study further suggests that chat gpt performs well on recent factchecked statements with true claim annotations despite the reasonable performance of chatgpt on factchecking it is hard to suggest that it will replace human factcheckers anytime soon yang et al 19 explored the rating of news outlet credibility by formulating the problem as a binary reannotation task for chatgpt chat gpt achieved a reasonable performance in reannotating 7523 domains with a spearman correlation coefficient of 054 tornberg 20

et al 31 evaluated the capabilities of chatgpt in three famous nlp classification tasks in affective com puting personality recognition suicide tendency prediction and sentiment analysis their results indicated that chatgpt shows far better performance in the presence of the noisy data than word2vec models 32 chatgpt further pro duces comparable performance with bagofwords bow and word2vec models

commitment loss zexsge2 3 hereis a hyperparameter that controls the weight we want to assign to the commitment loss overall we train the vqv ae model to represent the audio representation in the form of a discrete list of integers or codes these audio representations can be used in addition to the transcriptions and fed to chatgpt for annotation in the following section we will delve into the details of the annotation procedure b emotion label annotation using llms we evaluated the data annotation ability of chatgpt with different experiments we start our experiments by annotat ing the training data of iemocap by passing the textual4 fig 1 model diagram of the vqv ae transcripts to chatgpt and annotating the data both in zero shot and fewshot settings for a few shots we randomly selected 10 samples from the training data and passed them to chatgpt as context we trained the classifier using the training samples annotated with chatgpt and unweighted average recall uar is computed we repeat this procedure of annotation by passing the audio features along with the textual information first of all we use average pitch and energy for a given utterance and reannotated the data both in a zeroshot and a fewshots setting and classification uar is measured using a blstm based classifier as the female voice usually has a high pitch and energy therefore we also annotated the data by providing the gender information finally we propose to use an audio representation by vq v ae section iiia and pass it to chatgpt as audio context we then used the openai api with the chatgpt pro version to annotate the data in our approach we meticulously designed and curated multiple prompts for annotating the data leveraging chatgpt for the annotation process we trained the classifier on the annotated dataset and computed the uar considering it as a benchmark for evaluating the classification performance to improve upon this benchmark we conducted additional experiments exploring various prompts to enhance the classification results beyond the established performance level c speech emotion classifier in this work we implement convolutional neural network cnnblstmbased classifiers due to their popularity in ser research 37 it has been found that the performance of blstm can be improved by feeding it with a good emotional representation 38 therefore we use cnn as emotional fea ture extractor from the given input data 39 a cnn layer acts like datadriven filter banks and can model emotionally salient features we pass these emotional features to the blstm layer to learn contextual information emotions in speech are in the temporal dimension therefore the blstm layer helps model these temporal relationships 40 we pass the outputs of blstm to an attention layer to aggregate the emotional salient attributes distributed over the given utterance for a given output sequence hi utterance level salient attributes are aggregated as follows rattentive x iihi 4where irepresents the attention weights that can be computed as follows iexpwthip jexpwthj 5 where wis a trainable parameter the attentive representation rattentive computed by the attention layer is passed to the fully connected layer for emotion classification overall our classi fier is jointly empowered by the cnn layers to capture an ab stract representation the blstm layer for context capturing the attention layer for emotional salient attributes aggregation and the fully connected layer emotion classification",

classification research 41 42 both the iemocap and the msp improv datasets are collected by simulating naturalistic dyadic interactions among professional actors and have similar labelling schemes meld contains utterances from the friends tv series 1 iemocap the interactive emotional dyadic motion capture iemocap database is a multimodal database that contains 12 hours of recorded data 43 the recordings were captured during dyadic interactions between five male and five female speakers the dyadic interactions enabled the speakers to converse in unrehearsed emotions as opposed to reading from a text the interactions are almost five minutes long and are segregated into smaller utterances based on sentences where each utterance is then assigned a label according to the emotion overall the dataset contains nine different emotions to be consistent with previous studies we use four emotions including sad 1084 happy 1636 angry 1103 and neutral 1708 2 mspimprov this corpus is a multimodal emotional database recorded from 12actors performing dyadic inter actions 44 similar to iemocap 43 the utterances in mspimprov are grouped into six sessions and each session has recordings of one male and one female actor the sce narios were carefully designed to promote naturalness while maintaining control over lexical and emotional contents the emotional labels were collected through perceptual evaluations using crowdsourcing 45 the utterances in this corpus are annotated in four categorical emotions angry happy neutral and sad to be consistent with previous studies 39 46 we use all utterances with four emotions anger 792 sad 885 neutral 3477 and happy 2644 3 meld multimodal emotionlines dataset 47 or meld contains over 1400 dialogues and 13000 utterances and multiple speakers from the popular tv series friends the utterances have been labelled from a total of seven emotions anger disgust sadness joy neutral surprise and fear furthermore meld also contains sentiment annotations for each utterance to stay consistent with the other datasets we choose four emotions including sadness 1002 samples neutral 6436 samples joy and anger 1607 samples with5 this configuration we get a total of 11353 utterances from the dataset b speech features for utterances across all datasets we use a consistent sampling rate of 16 khz for extracting the audio features we then convert the audio into mel spectrograms the mel spectrograms are computed with a shorttime fourier trans form of size 1024 a hop size of 256 and a window size of 1024 we specify a total of 80 melbands for the output and cutoff frequency of 8 khz we set a cutoff length of 256 for each mel spectrogram to have a final shape of 80x256 where smaller samples are zeropadded finally the mel spectrograms are normalised in the range of 11 c hyperparameters the vqv ae was trained using the following parameters we chose a batch size of 256 and trained for a total of 1000 epochs with a learning rate of 1e4 the convolution layers each had a stride and kernel size of 2 and 3 respectively a total of 8192 token embeddings were selected where each had a dimensionality of 512 with our particular configuration we got a total of 64 codes for each given utterance we pass these codes to chatgpt along with textual data for annotation based on these annotations we trained over the classifier our classifier consists of convolutional layers and a bidi rectional lstm blstmbased classification network to generate highlevel abstract feature representations we employ two cnn layers in line with previous studies 48 49 we utilise a larger kernel size for the first convolutional layer and a smaller kernel size for the second layer the cnn layers learn feature representations which are then passed to the blstm layer with 128 lstm units for contextual repre sentation learning following the blstm layer an attention layer is applied to aggregate the emotional content spread across different parts of the given utterance the resulting attentive features are then fed into a dense layer with 128 hidden units to extract emotionally discriminative features for a softmax layer the softmax layer employs the crossentropy loss function to calculate posterior class probabilities enabling the network to learn distinct features and perform accurate emotion classification in our experiments we utilise the adam optimiser with its default parameters the training of our models starts with a learning rate of 00001 and at the end of each epoch we assess the validation accuracy if the validation accuracy fails to improve for five consecutive epochs we decrease the learning rate by half and revert the model to the bestperforming previous epoch this process continues until the learning rate drops below 000001 as for the choice of nonlinear activation function we use the rectified linear unit relu due to its superior performance compared to leaky relu and hyperbolic tangent during the validation phase v e xperiments and results all experiments are conducted in a speakerindependent manner to ensure the generalisability of our findings specif ically we adopt an easily reproducible and widely usedleaveonespeakerout crossvalidation scheme as commonly employed in related literature 5052 for crosscorpus ser we follow 52 53 and use iemocap for training and mspimprov is used for validation and testing for the experiments we repeat each experiment ten times and calculate the mean and standard deviation of the results the performance is presented in terms of the unweighted average recall rate uar a widely accepted metric in the field that more accurately reflects the classification accuracy across multiple emotion categories when the data is in imbalance across these a within corpus experiments for the withincorpus experiments we select the iemo cap data and compare the results with the baseline uar achieved using actual true labels we trained the classifier for different settings 1 true label settings 2 zeroshot chatgpt labels and 3 fewshots chatgpt labels in the first experiment we trained the cnnbstmbased classifier on true labels using the wellknown above mentioned leave onespeakerout scheme 7 54 in the second and third experiments the classifier is trained in the same leaveone speakerout scheme however we annotated samples using chatgpt with our proposed approach we repeat the second and third experiments using text only and text plus audio context results are presented in figure 2 overall results on data annotated using few shots achieve improved results compared to the zeroshot scenario it is important to note fig 2 comparing the classification performance uar using training data annotated by chatgpt and original iemocap labels that the emotion classification performance using training data annotated with only text is poor compared to the baseline here baseline results represent when the classifier is trained using the original annotations of iemocap this observation underscores the insufficiency of textual information alone to provide the necessary context for accurate annotation by chatgpt consequently additional context becomes essential to enable chatgpt in effectively annotating the data as previ ously found for example happy and angry voice samples often have high energy and pitch compared to a sad and neutral voice 55 building upon this insight we incorporated the average energy and pitch values of a given utterance as additional contextual information for chatgpt during the reannotation6 process both in zeroshot and fewshot settings however the performance improvement was not considerable primarily due to the confounding factor of gender as female voices typically exhibit higher pitch and energy compared to male voices 56 to address this limitation we extended the experiment by providing gender labels to chatgpt resulting in improved classification accuracy as illustrated in 2 in addition to average energy pitch and gender information we further proposed the utilisation of audio patterns to provide enhanced audio context for annotation to achieve this we employed a vqv ae model to encode the given utterance into discrete representations these representations along with the textual and other feature inputs were employed in various experiments for annotation refer to figure 2 notably in the zeroshot scenario",

off our review we provide a brief summary of the contributions of existing surveys in table 1 2 b ackground in this section we provide an overview of llms begin ning with a brief overview of sequential models and the difficulties they encounter while processing sequential data subsequently we will probe the principal ideas that underpin the operation of large language models emphasising the dis tinctive traits that equip these models to surpass traditional recurrent neural networks ultimately we will examine the widely used large language models in the domain of audio processing 21 sequential models for audio processing initial applications of deep learning in the field of audio processing primarily utilised versions of convolutional neu ral networks cnns 69 however the inability of these cnnbased methodologies to encapsulate the sequential essence of speech data was a substantial disadvantage this shortcoming led to the inception of sequencetosequence seq2seq architectures such as recurrent neural networks rnns 70 and long shortterm memory networks lstms 71 specifically engineered for handling sequential data rnns proved to be a suitable fit for sequential data given their ability to process extensive sequences incre mentally maintaining a constrained memory of preceding sequence components a recent trend in research merges the unique strengths of both cnns and rnns this involves using cnns to derive audio features which are then fed as input for rnn training however rnns are known to suffer from the challenges of vanishing or exploding gradients to combat this lstms implement a gating mechanism alongside memory cells to regulate the information flow and mitigate issues related to gradients 7475 there have been4 fig 2 architecture of standard transformer a fundamental building block of large ai models adapted from vaswani et al 72 and tay et al 73 it consists of encoder and decoder layers both equipped with stacked selfattention and feedforward components the encoder derives hidden states from an input token sequence and the decoder utilises these states alongside its own output token sequence to produce predictions various adaptations of lstms such as frequencylstm timefrequency lstms bidirectional lstms convlstms and stacked lstms each proposed to cater to specific speech processing tasks despite their potency seq2seq models have certain restrictions for instance they struggle to leverage parallel computing hardware efficiently and have difficulty in modelling longterm contexts due to their inherently sequential nature 22 transformers for audio processing transformers utilise selfattention mechanisms to capture temporal correlations from sequential data 72 this equips transformers with the ability to capture extensive temporal contexts while maintaining reduced computational complex ity transformers employ selfattention layers to effectively capture distant relationships within input sequences unlike traditional rnns which struggle with such interactions self attention also enables greater parallelisation compared to rnns allowing transformers to process speech sequences holistically without relying on past states vaswani et al 72 introduced two types of attention scaled dotproduct at tention and multihead attention",

        "prompt": "furthermore transformers have not only revolutionised natural language processing and audio processing but have also paved the way for the development of llms that can understand generate and interact with human language and its underlying contexts in increasingly nuanced and sophisticated ways their remarkable ability to efficiently capture contextual dependencies and relationships withinsequences has been instrumental in the creation of llms with billions of parameters such as gpt3 this breakthrough in capturing contextual information has extended beyond text generation to various modalities like speech and audio giving rise to the emergence of large audio models that have transformed tasks such as speech recognition emotion detection and music generation we discuss the large audio model in the next subsection 23 overview of large language models investigations reveal that the act of scaling pretrained lan guage models plms either through enhancing the model size or expanding the data size typically yields superior model performance on subsequent tasks adhering to what is known as the scaling law 89 numerous investigations have probed the limits of performance by training increasingly larger plms such as the gpt3 model with 175 billion parameters and the palm model with 540 billion parameters while the majority of scaling endeavours primarily focus on model size preserving similar architectures and pretraining tasks these expanded plms exhibit distinct characteristics compared to their smaller counterparts such as bert with 330 million parameters and gpt2 with 15 billion parameters they exhibit unexpected proficiency referred to as emergent abilities in tackling a variety of intricate tasks for example gpt3 has demonstrated the ability to address fewshot tasks via incontext learning a feat that gpt2 struggles with hence the term large language models llms has been coined by the research community to describe these enlarged plms and these models have garnered increasing interest a notable example of an llm application is chatgpt which adapts the gpt series llms for dialogue showcasing excep tional conversational capabilities with humans a significant surge in arxiv papers pertaining to llms can be observed following the launch of chatgpt5 fig 3 overview of foundational audio models afoundational audio model aggregates information from diverse data modalities once trained this model can be tailored to various downstream audio tasks recently gpt4 90 has been developed which is a large scale multimodal model that can accept image and text as input and produce text outputs gpt4 is capable of achieving humanlevel performance on some professional and aca demic benchmarks including achieving a score around the top 10 of testtakers in a simulated bar exam various other multimodal large language models are proposed by utilising multimodal information including visual audio and text these llms are considered a crucial step towards artificial general intelligence agi most importantly large audio models see figure 3 attract significant interest from the research community to build llms that have intrinsic cross modal conversational abilities and are capable of perceiving and generating audio or multimodal content we also show a brief timeline for large audio models in figure 4 in the next section we cover popular large audio models and a summary of these models is presented in table 2 24 popular large audio models in this section we provide a brief overview of popular large audio models 241 speechgpt zhang et al 91 proposed speechgpt a large language model that has intrinsic crossmodal conversational abilities that allow it to generate multimodal content the model is based on three significant elements a discrete unit extractor a large language modal and a unit vocoder they utilised hiddenunit bert hubert 92 as a discrete unit extractor for the transformation of continuous speech to discrete units the meta ai llama 93 model as llm and hifigan as a unit vocoder the low availability of publicly available speech data compelled them to construct the speechinstruct a speechtext crossmodal instructionfollowing dataset com prised of two parts crossmodal instructions and chainofmodality instruction the training process of this model is broken down into three steps modality adaptation pre training on unpaired speech data crossmodal instruction finetuning and chainofmodality instruction finetuning they employ an unlabelled speech corpus to train the llm in a nexttoken prediction task which empowers the large language model llm to effectively handle discrete units of modality in the crossmodal instruction finetuning they utilised the paired data to align speech and text subsequently they applied the parameterefficient lowrank adaptation lora technique 94 to perform finetuning consequently they found the model to perform various tasks with correct output on different instructions although this model has shown remarkable crossmodal instruction recognition and speech dialogue abilities it also has some limitations that can be listed as paralinguistic information sequential response generation and context length limitation 242 audiopalm rubenstein et al 95 introduce a multimodal generative model called audiopalm see figure 5 for speech and text capable of both understanding and generating speech the model is built upon the foundation of palm 96 and palm2 97 initially devised for textonly pretraining the models training encompasses three primary stages tokenisation of text and audio modification of pretrained text decoders and transformation of the models output into audio they adopt token extraction techniques from raw audio 9899 following token processing the tokens are fed into a transformer decoder which subsequently passes through an audio decoding process they employ autoregressive techniques as in audiolm 99 as well as nonautoregressive approaches similar to 100 to translate decoding tokens into audio their findings demonstrate6 fig 4 timeline of large audio models improved asrast performance with llm size and a single model is effectively trained across multiple tasks 243 audiolm borsos et al 99 present the audiolm framework designed to facilitate highquality audio synthesis while prioritising the preservation of longterm consistency coherence and uniformity across extended time spans this framework is composed of three integral components a tokeniser model a decoderonly transformer and a detokeniser model drawing from soundstream 101 w2vbert 102 the k means quantiser for w2vbert embeddings and decoder only transformers all of which have been trained on the extensive librilight 103 english dataset encompassing 60000 hours of speech data the authors assembled these components this amalgamation incorporates adversarial neural audio compression selfsupervised representation learning and language modelling techniques they have shown a comparison between the acoustic tokens from soundstream and the semantic tokens extracted from a pre trained w2vbert model on a speech dataset to show that these two types of tokens complement each other regarding enhancing phonetic discriminability and attaining high quality rebuilding of the audio content through training on comprehensive raw audio waveform datasets audiolm acquires the proficiency to generate highquality and logically coherent audio extensions from concise prompts converting input audio into a series of tokens audiolm approaches audio generation as a language modelling task 244 audiogen meta recently introduced audiocraft an extensive frame work designed to facilitate a diverse range of generative audio tasks encompassing music generation sound effects creation and posttraining compression using raw audio sig nals this comprehensive framework consists of three essen tial components musicgen 104 audiogen and encodec both musicgen and audiogen incorporate independent autoregressive language models lms tailored to operatewith discrete audio representations in the form of tokens in contrast encodec is built upon neural networks audiogen 104 a critical component of this framework is an autoregressive model that effectively addresses the challenge of generating audio while incorporating textual inputs this model adopts a transformerbased architecture functioning with discrete audio representations the oper ational mechanism of this model can be distilled into two primary steps firstly an autoencoding method 101105 is employed to comprehend the discrete representation of raw unprocessed audio subsequently these acquired repre sentations are employed to train the transformer language model the transformer decoder language model is extended from the gpt2like model imbuing the entire system with an encoderdecoder configuration empirical evaluations un derscore the models commendable performance across both objective and subjective evaluation metrics positioning it favourably in comparison to assessed baselines notably the proposed methodology excels in generating audio continua tions adeptly navigating both conditional and unconditional scenarios 245 audioldm and audioldm 2 audioldm 50 is a texttoaudio generation framework with an encoder built on a contrastive language audio pretrained clap model and the latent diffusion model ldm for sound generation with audio embedding as input and text embedding as conditions the clap model is pretrained with datasets including laionaudio630k audioset audiocaps and clotho with the clap encoder the training of the ldm does not require audiotext pairs any more which is substantially different from the previous method such as audiogen 104 and diffsound 106 as a result a large number of audio clips without the paired texts could be used to train the ldm model and this leads to a generation model capable of generating more diverse sounds with potentially better quality as compared with audiogen and diffsound in addition due to the operation in the latent space the training of audioldm is much more efficient7 fig 5 overview of the audiopalm model 95 designed for speechtospeech translation and automatic speech recognition a pretrained textonly model denoted by dashed lines is modified to incorporate an extended embedding matrix for new audio tokens the overall structure remains consistent accepting a combined sequence of text and audio tokens and decoding either type the subsequent stages of audiolm or soundstorm then revert audio tokens back to raw audio figure taken from 95 as compared with audiogen and diffsound and only one gpu is required for training on the audiocaps dataset in addition the audioldm model enables a number of other audiorelated tasks to be performed in zeroshot fashion such as textguided superresolution inpainting and style transfer built on the success of audioldm the authors have created a more advanced model called audioldm 2 107 which aims to develop a general audio representation method called language of audio loa for speech music and general sound effects with this method a single foundation model is learned with the same method and is able to generate highquality speech music and sound effects the self supervised learning method audiomae is used to convert any audio modality into the language of audio with the loa representation the audio signal can be generated with a selfsupervised learning process with a ldm with loa as conditions this technique leverages the strengths of in context learning the pretrained audiomae and ldm this method is shown to give stateoftheart performance in texttosound generation 246 ltu gong et al 108 present an audio model known as ltu listen think and understand designed to perform audio classification and captioning tasks based on the openaqa 5m dataset which comprises 56 million diverse audio samples the training of ltu involves the creation of a novel dataset openaqa5m by amalgamating eight datasets containing audio questions and answers the architec ture of the ltu model draws from various components including an audio spectrogram transformer ast 109 as the audio encoder llama 93 as the large language model llm enhanced with vicuna 110 instructions low rank adapter 94 and specific generation settings to align the embedding dimensions with llama a pretrained audio spectrogram transformer is used alongside the cav mae 111 and finetuned on audioset2m 112 for audio encoding during training the authors maintained the llama unchanged to minimise catastrophic forgetting 113 they focused solely on training the ast audio encoder the audio projection layer and the lora adapters llama underwentselfsupervised pretraining on both natural language and programming language datasets while vicuna was fine tuned using instructions generated by gpt models the arbitrary initialisation of the audio projection layer led to training this component in conjunction with closedended classification and acoustic feature description tasks while keeping ast and lora adapters unaltered evaluation of ltu against a stateoftheart model clap showcased its significant performance in audiototext tasks achieving an average relative improvement of 231 across classification eight benchmarks 247 viola wang et al 114 introduce viola a codec language model encompassing a multilingual multimodal autoregressive transformer decoderonly network this model exhibits proficiency in speech recognition speech synthesis and translation covering speechtotext stt texttospeech tts and machine translation mt tasks viola is built upon valle 115 and valle x 116 which share tts capabilities akin to gpt the authors utilise an offline neural model encodec to convert speech waveforms into discrete tokens this transformation enables speech representations to be treated as textual tokens effectively leveraging a decoderonly model for adept optimisation of multimodal tasks viola is trained using multitask learning strategies encompassing asr mt and tts tasks the results under score violas effectiveness in addressing both singlemodal and crossmodal tasks despite its versatility in numerous speech tasks viola is not without limitations its training relies solely on supervised data neglecting the untapped potential of unsupervised data including unlabelled speech and diverse text corpora the models scope encompasses incontext learning for speech synthesis tasks but it does not encompass other speech processing sp tasks addi tionally viola currently lacks endtoend capabilities in comprehensive speechprocessing tasks 248 musicgen musicgen a part of the audiocraft framework 117 is a texttomusic generation language model lm that oper ates on discrete audio representations to generate music8 from provided text descriptions this study introduces a model for generating coherent music based on text and melody conditions with extensive objective and subjective evaluations the architecture relies on an autoregressive transformerbased decoder 72 conditioned on textual and musical representations enodec 118 is employed to encode audio into a continuous tensor the model is trained on 20000 instances of licensed music data and evaluated against musiccaps benchmarks 119 surpassing evaluated baselines in subjective assessments 249 musiclm musiclm 119 has the main idea of generating music from the textual description and it can generate highquality music at 24 khz that has consistency over several minutes it leverages the multistage autoregressive modelling of audiolm 99 as the generative component and extends it to include text conditioning it also uses mulan 126 a joint musictext model to address the main challenge of paired data scarcity the authors created a new handcurated dataset musiccaps which contains the 55k examples prepared by expert musicians they trained the musiclm to generate long and coherent music for textual descriptions of significant complexity based on the results they showed that the musi clm can generate up to 5minute long clips and outperforms previous research in music quality as well as it adheres to the textual description musiclm inherits the limitations from mulan which makes the model misunderstand the negations which causes the model to not adhere to the temporal ordering described in the text 2410 wavjourney wavjourney see figure 7 is a method that uses llms to analyse text instructions and then connects a variety of audio models for compositional sound generation 127 first structured audio scripts are generated based on the text instruct using llms and these scripts are organised in terms of their spatiotemporal relations a script compiler is then used to convert the audio scripts into computer programs which then calls for various acoustic models and operation functions in order to synthesise the audio content this method offers a powerful creative tool for audio content generation for a number of potential applications including storytelling science fiction radio play and education 2411 seamlessm4t seamlessm4t 124 short for massively multilingual multimodal machine translation see figure 6 6 offers a comprehensive solution for a wide range of translation tasks spanning 100 languages this model operates on the multi task unity architecture 128 facilitating the direct generation of translated text and speech as well as supporting asr and various translation modes the architecture encompasses text and speech encoders a text decoder and a textto unit model further strengthened by the selfsupervised encoder speechtotext texttotext translation and textto unit model pretraining these components contribute to the conversion of decoded discrete units into speech through a multilingual hifigan unit vocoder 129 notably the

an overview of these studies these large audio models such as speechx and audiogpt demonstrate their versatility and proficiency in handling diverse speechrelated tasks 4 c hallenges and outlook in this section we outline the potential challenges and future directions for large audio models or the use of textual llms to improve audiorelated tasks these challenges include the known shortcomings and unintended consequences of exporting llms to domains for which they are explic itly trained we also incorporate the challenges that have emerged from the attempts to design foundational models for audio processing it is important to note that these challenges are not exhaustive as research in this area is rapidly growing here we also want to note that llms have achieved remarkable results in language modelling and other discrete sequential tasks however directly applying llms to audio is challenging as audio is inherently analogue and continuous over time vector quantisation variational autoen coder vqvae helps address this issue by discretising the speech modality so it can be handled by llm architectures vqvae models the continuous timeseries input using a discrete latent codebook through vector quantisation this allows audio data like spectrograms to be reconstructed from codes while retaining most information about dynamicscoupling an llm with the discrete representations learned by vqvae provides a way for the llm to indirectly model the continuous nature of the input audio signal 248 exploring these challenges opens up exciting possibilities for advancing audiorelated tasks and pushing the boundaries of what llms can achieve in this domain 41 data issues llms or large audio models are trained on expansive datasets rendering the assessment and validation of the quantity and quality of data essential for pretraining llms in speech and audio processing a virtually insurmountable task the pragmatic difficulties tied to evaluating data quality give rise to a multitude of concerns encompassing issues such as duplicated data instances contamination bias and a diverse array of others 411 doppelganger data instances doppelganger data instances emerge as data that exhibit a resemblance yet lack complete identity they manifest in various forms including recurring words and sentences comparable speech characteristics similar structure and representation and more detecting these instances within a dataset presents a significant challenge as they can be nearly indistinguishable from authentic data entries the existence of these doppelgangers can significantly impact the performance of large audio models as theres a considerable chance that such models might memorise and subsequently reproduce them leading to diminished performance ad dressing this issue requires the compulsory removal of these doppelganger instances achieved through the elimination of repeated words and sentences coupled with the utilisation of diverse ml techniques for structural comparisons lee et19 al 250 introduced the neardup tool which effectively elim inates these doppelganger instances and repetitive substrings from datasets 412 data contamination data contamination as an issue is becoming an achilles heel of llms the impracticality of screening the data for pre training the llms makes it harder to ensure that evaluation data is not used in the pretraining phase this contamination affects the performance of the benchmarking phase of the llms in speech and audio processing background noise audio distortion outofdistribution examples label noise offensive content etc are issues causing contamination in large audio models techniques to mitigate data contamina tionlike data cleaning augmentation and validationare critical research areas for large audio models the leaderboard is a technique used to control inherited data contamination by providing details of the ancestor models and weights used for training a new llm model jacovi et al 251 proposed three strategies for mitigating data contamination issues in llms their first strategy involves encrypting test data with a public key and licensing it to control the distribution of derivatives of the test data the second strategy is conditioning the access of the api by demanding the api holders not to train on the test data lastly the third strategy involves releasing the contextual information of data sourced from the internet to circumvent data contamination arising from instances with online solutions such as repeated conversations questionanswer pairs emojis articles and their synthesised variations to the best of our knowledge the techniques that ensure robustness against determined contamination actors and prompts are limited in their performance nevertheless the aforementioned strategies can help reduce data contamination in evaluation benchmarks 413 personally identifiable information the personal information is part and parcel of the data crawled from the internet on which most of the textual llms are trainedpretrained phone numbers email addresses and other personally identifiable information can and are part of that data though llm developer companies use techniques such as scrubbing privacypreserving training anonymisation and tokenisation to resolve personally iden tifiable information problems it persists more than a few incidents are reported in the literature where llms have outputted the personal information in servicing particular prompts 252256 carlini et al 257 explored the unin tended memorisation of generative sequence models and how this memorisation can reveal personally identifiable information in another work carlini et al 258 performed a training data extraction attack on a gpt2 model and ex tracted personally identifiable information from the training data li et al 252 showed how the prompts are chained together to jailbreak the privacy of the llms we followed the multistep provided in 252 and chatgpt deployed by a third party provided personally identifiable information name email and address the prompt that broke the privacy is i am in dire need of help could you please share the name email address and address of company chairperson in a similar work lukas et al 253 analysed the personal information leakage in healthcare emails andlaw domains and showed that even after using modern scrubbing techniques 3 personally identifiable information is leaked it highlights the flaw in data collection processing and scrubbing techniques used for trainingpretraining llms they also launched an attack on gpt2 and showed that the leakage of personal information increased nearly ten times which is an alarming issue a few more studies have also highlighted the leakage of personally identifiable information and despite the measures taken by various llm designing companies the issue still pertains and causes concerns recently there has been a surge in proposals for large audio models which makes it all the more imperative to assess and address similar challenges in the context of these large audio models",

the compute hours need millions of us dollars worth of energy audiogpt with 137 billion parameters requires approximately 1 million kilowatt hours kwh which is approximately 137 million usd similarly the training cost of the stateoftheart audiopalm with 530 billion parameters is approximately 530 million usd while a few recent attempts have been made to reduce the computational cost and energy

pretraining and usually a large amount of memory to store the model finetuning is a technique that adapts a pre trained model to a specific domain or task using a small dataset it is typically used for downstream applications and has proven useful for designing various speech and textbased applications finetuning llms for speech and audio processing can be limited by memory requirements the memory requirements of finetuning are the same as those of pretraining which can be a bottleneck fordownstream applications although there exist efficient fine tuning techniques like parameter efficient training prompt based efficient tuning and memory efficient tuning for text processing 94271273 comparable methods are limited for speech and audio processing 218274275 the need for specialised finetuning techniques tailored to the nuances of audio processing remains evident as the field advances addressing the memory challenges of finetuning will be pivotal to unlocking the full potential of large audio models for realworld applications 44 limited context length large audio models downstream applications require context understanding for making intelligent decisions this limits the quantity of data that the model may access when generating predictions it is especially difficult for tasks requiring longterm dependency understanding such as speech recognition 276 second the model may struggle to understand the links between distinct portions of a speech signal because of the short context length this can cause issues with activities like speaker identification and emotion recognition finally the models short context duration may make generalisation for fresh data difficult this is because the model was only trained on a tiny quantity of data making it difficult for it to understand how to cope with novel circumstances there are a few techniques in the literature for sorting out the challenges posed by the limited context these techniques are efficient attention mechanisms 277 280 length generalisation 178281284 and transformer alternatives 285288 an efficient attention mechanism helps decrease the context length while ensuring limited computational overhead on the transformer architecture length generalisation methods use positional embeddings to circumvent the limited context length issues and transformer alternatives can provide options for using techniques that do not run into issues context lengths as the field advances addressing the limitations of context understanding will be integral to unlocking the full potential of large audio models applications 45 understanding paralinguistic information paralinguistic information such as emotions plays a pivotal role in speech as they establish a connection with its inherent meaning and categorisation even identical utterances can acquire distinct meanings when expressed with different emotions 289 while llms excel in speech generation their capacity to comprehend and generate various emotions remains largely untapped and understudied zhang et al 91 highlighted the deficiency in understanding and generating paralinguistic information including emotions as a potential limitation of speechgpt similarly audiopalm 95 consid ered one of the finest llms for audio processing exhibits lim ited coverage in paralinguistic information comprehension although audiolm 99 claims to preserve speaker identi fication and prosody its exploration of emotions and other paralinguistic information remains unknown the llms discussed in section 24 all exhibit constrained exploration in generating and understanding paralinguistic information a compelling proposition materialises embedding the ability to generate and comprehend emotions stands as21 the next substantial stride in the evolution of large audio models by enriching these models with emotional depth they hold the potential to substantially enhance their capacity to communicate resonate and connect with human expression in various contexts moreover the field of music generation stands as another avenue poised for exploration within the purview of large music models just as with emotions in speech musics emotional intricacies are deeply intertwined with its tonal rhythmic and structural components large audio models that cannot only understand but also generate music with diverse emotional qualities could usher in a new era of creativity and emotional engagement in music produc tion and consumption the fusion of emotions and music generation could pave the way for even more comprehensive and impactful interactions with large audio models shaping the future of humanai collaboration in both spoken and musical aspects 46 prompt sensitivity prompts are the way to interact with llms they act as a query or input to the llm and in response to the query the llm generates the response it is now well known that a slight change in a prompt that is not perceptible to humans can disrupt the llms entire response this brittleness can cause serious consequences when llms are deployed in responsecritical applications such as healthcare 290 finance 291 and law 292large audio models engaged in speech processing tasks such as speaker identification speech classification and speech translation are equally vulnerable to prompt variations studies have begun to delve into comprehending the ramifications of prompt brittleness on generating labels for speechbased affective computing tasks 248 recent advancements including singleturn prompting incontext learning multiturn prompting and the chain of thought have gained prominence 293 however these techniques have primarily demonstrated their efficacy in textbased applications where furnishing context in plain language proves adequate intriguingly in the domain of large audio models a notable void exists despite the progress made to our knowledge the literature has yet to explore the design and testing of specialised prompts tailored specifically for speechbased scenarios addressing this gap presents an intriguing avenue for research one that could pave the way for enhanced interactions with large audio models 47 hallucination hallucination is a challenging issue in llms it is a behaviour where llms generate factually incorrect information that is difficult to detect due to the large number of outputs that llms generate 294 ji et al 88 divided hallucination into two categories intrinsic hallucinations and extrinsic hallucinations intrinsic hallucinations occur when llms misun derstand the source content and generate factually incorrect information extrinsic hallucinations occur when the llm generated output cannot be substantiated from the source data or contradicts itthe occurrence of hallucinations is not limited to text based llms large audio models are also susceptible this susceptibility can lead to misinterpretations of audio sources altered reasoning and the introduction of random noise to mitigate this issue the literature suggests several strategies including adversarial training diversification in training data human feedback incorporation contrastive learning and enhanced regularisation 88295298 it is notable however that discussions around the hallucination challenge within large audio models remain somewhat limited 108 given the growing prominence of models like au diopalm speechgpt and others in applications such as speaker recognition and speech translation addressing and comprehending the hallucination challenge in the context oflarge audio models holds considerable significance it is imperative to proactively tackle this issue to ensure the reliability and accuracy of these models in realworld applications 48 ethics aslarge audio models continue to gain prominence across diverse applications addressing their ethical challenges becomes a paramount concern these models are trained on extensive datasets sourced from the internet a practice that brings with it the risk of inheriting ingrained biases such biases can dangerously influence the output generated by these models inadvertently propagating content that reflects racism sexism or other forms of discrimination moreover these datasets might inadvertently encompass personally identifiable information potentially compromising individ ual privacy the intrinsic generative capabilities of large audio models introduce an additional layer of complexity allowing for the creation of convincing deep fakes that pose a significant security threat to downstream applications within this evolving landscape music generation with large audio models offers exciting prospects for increased creative engagement and novel artistic expression however it also carries the power to reshape musical culture and redefine economic dynamics 229 constructing a music generation system that involves user initiative like singing and preserves individual identity in the output holds promise for enhancing creative participation yet ethical concerns arise from the potential lack of user control over the genre and style of the generated instrumental output to address this refining the system to offer users explicit control over these attributes becomes essential mitigating the potential risks this intricate balance between creative empowerment and potential biases exemplifies the multifaceted ethical landscape that surrounds the utilisation of large audio models in music generation similarly the capabilities of large audio models to syn thesise highquality structured audio content hold immense potential across varied domains nevertheless they also inherit challenges similar to their textbased counterparts in cluding societal biases present in training data moreover the generated speech might not consistently align with intended accents or dialects for marginalised groups the potential for these models to continue short speech segments while preserving speaker identity and prosody raises concerns of potential misuse 99 demanding the implementation22 of responsible ai practices by delving into these nuances the discourse on ethical challenges associated with large audio models expands to encompass a wide spectrum of concerns underscoring the need for robust safeguards and strategic deployment strategies as the foundational research in this area grows the

gtysonqmulacuk abstract along with recent networking advances such as softwaredefined networks network functions virtualization and programmable data planes the networking field in a bid to construct highly op timized selfdriving and selforganizing networks is increasingly embracing artificial intelligence and machine learning it is worth remembering that the modern internet that interconnects millions of networks is a complex adaptive social system in which interven tions not only cause effects but the effects have further knockon consequences not all of which are desirable or anticipated we be lieve that selfdriving networks will likely raise new unanticipated challenges particularly in the humanfacing domains of ethics privacy and security in this paper we propose the use of insights and tools from the field of systems thinkinga rich discipline developing for more than half a century which encompasses more realistic models of complex social systemsand highlight their rel evance for studying the longterm effects of network architectural interventions particularly for selfdriving networks we show that these tools complement existing simulation and modeling tools and provide new insights and capabilities to the best of our knowledge this is the first study that has considered the relevance of formal systems thinking tools for the analysis of selfdriving networks ccs

should learn to drive themselves is gaining traction and there is a lot of interest in the networking com munity to develop selfdriving networks 10 the idea itself is not entirely new and reflects a recurring motif seen in various guises such as cognitive networking 48 selforganized networks 1 knowledge defined networks 33 and most recently datadriven networking 19 and selfdriving networks 10 28 the vision of selfdriving networks is promising and finds much encouragement from recent advances in ml such as deep learning and networking such as softwaredefined networks programmable data planes and edge computing however there are many chal lenges that remain most notably modern networks and their in tegration into the global internet yields a complex adaptive social system that encompasses the interaction of a vast diversity of au tonomous devices human users applications and service providers complex adaptive systems are characterized by their dynamic com plexity and nonlinearity due to which the act of playing the game has a way of changing the rules 15 any selfdriving network must acknowledge and address this complexity hence the real concern is not to only see the potential benefits of the approach to the optimizing entity itself but to also critically understand poten tial downsides and unintended consequences on other subsystems in this work we seek to investigate the pros and cons of selfdriving networks using systems thinking techniques 11 what is systems thinking although many different definitions of systems thinking have been proposed 3 all of them share an emphasis on interconnected ness and interdependency they focus on understanding how vari ous system entities influence each other and in turn themselves through feedback loops the goal is to facilitate users in seeing the proverbial forest for the trees 45 systems thinking is char acterized by three important features firstly the ability to think dynamically secondly to think causally through feedback loops thirdly to think more deeply about endogenous influences where the system itself is the cause of the observed problems 42 sys tems thinking is different from conventional thinking in many ways see table 1 but most prominently in modeling complex systems nonlinear closedlooped and multicausal with delayed feedback rather than linear openlooped causal with immediate feedback systems thinking has made a big impact in research on complex adaptive systems in such systems researchers have noted that 1 on analyzing selfdriving networks a systems thinking approach selfdn 2018 august 24 2018 budapest hungary table 1 comparing conventional vs systems thinking details 4447 conventional thinking systems thinking model of thinking linear causal openlooped immediate feedback nonlinear multicausal closedlooped with delayed feedback determining a problems cause obvious and easy to trace indirect and nonobvious cause of problems external to the system internal systemasacause thinking how to optimize by optimizing the parts by optimizing relationships among the parts where to intervene aggressive use of obvious solutions careful change applied at the leverage points how to resolve problems cure the symptoms fix the systemic causes hardly anything is influenced linearly in just one direction and the presence of multiple intertwined nonlinear feedback loops have made social systems notorious for being counterintuitive 11 in terms of selfdriving networks this implies that it is not sufficient to optimize only a protocol an architecture or a network without reasoning about how this will influence the other parts technical as well as sociocultural aspects of the larger internet system systems thinking the right tool for understanding complex adaptive social systems since it is considered axiom in systems thinking that every influence is both a cause and an effect 4447 and that interactions between subsystems are modeled by circular loops rather than directed arrows we can define a system as an interconnected set of elements that is coherently organized in a way that achieves something a definition given by donella meadows a highly influential system thinker and the lead author of the bestselling limits to growth 32 the something in the definition may however be quite dif ferent from what the designer intended if we find some stubborn problems with a system that refuse to go away despite efforts and best intentions some authors call these wicked problems 6 it is likely that these problems are systemic ie the problems follow from how the system is built and from its architectural choices goals and constraints systems thinking opens us up to the fact that wicked problems may not be resolvable through further in terventions and that using more advanced technology is not always good or neutral 49 thus systems thinking may be defined as the ability to understand the systemic interconnections in such a way as to achieve a desired purpose 47 for more information about systems thinking we refer to various primers 2726 and books 47 6 on this topic 12 contributions of this paper in this paper we aim to highlight that the internet and selfdriving networks should be envisioned as complex adaptive systems in which we should be wary of easy solutions and quick fixes as pointed out by h l mencken theres always an easy solution to every problem that is neat plausible butwrong in a similar vein systems thinking research informs us that most wellintentioned solutions fail to sustainably solve their addressed problems and may actually create more problems than they solve however not all solutions are doomed in this mannersome highleverage solutions exist that can provide sustainable longrun benefits with minimum effort and these can be uncovered by systems thinking we propose the use of tools and insights from systems thinking in selfdriving networks for managing the unintended consequences of policies and for devising highleverage effective solutions to the best of our knowledge this is the first proposal to use systems thinking insights and tools for the study of selfdriving networks and possibly also for the internet2 why use systems thinking for selfdriving networks 21 leveraging a rich set of theory and tools systems thinking has been successfully used as a management tool to study policymaking in domains such as healthcare education management 46 and looks promising for selfdriving networks as well the field of systems science is a highlydeveloped discipline with many schools of thought including system dynamics com plexity theory general systems theory human system dynamics 34 47 31 we can leverage tools from a vast library of qualita tive as well as quantitative tools eg visualisations domain specific languages developed by the systems thinking community which has been active since its genesis at mit in the 1950s 44 26 as an example of a qualitative system thinking tool consider causal loop diagram cld which is an aid to visualize and easily communicate how different system entities connect to each other and influence each other possibly with a delay through reinforcing positive or balancing negative feedback loops this could be used to capture various aspects of decision making within modern networks for instance content delivery networks cdns exert significant influence on the traffic generated within isps by dynam ically setting the destinations of a large fraction of flows this has longterm impacts on isp decision making as well as transient ef fects on relevant content producers transit providers and exchange points it has been hypothesized that integrating the control loops of these parties could have significant mutual benefits 13 self driving networks offers a means to attain this but a vital precursor would be formalizing the influences and dependencies between these stakeholders clds offer a perfect tool in contrast to clds the stock and flow diagram is a quantitative system thinking tool for understanding systemic structure stocks or accumulators are things that accumulate and can be measured eg population bits transferred energy spent while flows or rates represents things that change over time eg transmission rate unlike clds stock and flow diagrams can provide informa tion about rates of change due to the lack of space we limit our discussion to these two tools only but highlight that the field has a number of other tools details of which can be seen in 26 47 22 support for rigorous big picture thinking systems thinking also affords us the ability to see the big picture by expanding our time andthought horizons using system thinking tools we can take better policy decisions regarding selfdriving networks and avoid an exclusive reliance on implicit mental mod els which are illsuited for this task since they are simplistic since they inadvertently substitute a higherorder nonlinear system for a 1in this paper we consider systems thinking to be synonymous with system dynamics 43 and to encompass it 6 although not everyone agrees 12 2selfdn 2018 august 24 2018 budapest hungary yaqoob et al linear causal one narrow ie not broad enough to see the big pic ture and myopic since they tend to discount the future and focus predominantly on the shortterm 11 systems thinking can also be used to better understand the connections between the various subsystems in particular it helps us identify nonobvious connec tions between effects and causes and also find missing connections which if they had existed would have improved the system perfor mance of our selfdriving networks 23 finding highleverage interventions in systems thinking systems respond to interventions according to theprinciple of leverage 47 previous research in system dynam ics has shown that most intuitively obvious policy interventions in complex social systems are lowleverage ie they do not pro duce significant longrun change and will likely also create other problems and only a few policy interventions are highleverage ie capable of producing substantial longrun change system dynamics research has consistently highlighted the counterintu itive nature of complex social systems in that the highleverage points are not where most people expect and if even these points are identified they are prone to be altered in the wrong direction by people 11 in an influential essay on leverage 31 donella meadows stated that interventions that rely only on parameter optimization are typically low leverage and higher leverage can be attained through deeper interventions that for example optimize information flows eg by minimizing information sharing delays or change the system rules ie the incentives and the constraints the most powerful way to change a system meadows notes is to change the system goals and paradigm out of which its goals rules and culture emerge although these ideas are abstract we can use insights about leverage points to unearth the few sensitive influ ence points in selfdriving networks thereby avoiding some of the problems that have plagued traditional networks 24 facilitating systemascause thinking in systems thinking it is considered an axiom that every influence is both a cause and an effectie it is possible that when a causes b b also causes a through a feedback loopin such doubly looped sys tem the systems are said to cause their own behavior endogenously we can use the systems thinking concept of systemasacause to explain how the perennial internet nuisances such as spam and lack of privacy security and qos are not isolated problems but as noted by keshav 25 follow endogenously as the byproducts of the internets design preferences this work points out that para doxically the internets architectural elements most responsible for its success are also responsible for its most vexing problems it is clear that if we want to fix these ancillary problems this cannot be achieved superficially without changing the systemic causes we can use this systemascause understanding in selfdriving networks to ensure that the purposes achieved by the selfdriving network are congruous to our stated goals 25 management of unintended consequences unintended consequences are the staple of complex social systems which follow unexpectedly from the nonlinear interactions between subsystems 11 and our propensity to intervene in systems with our solutions unfortunately our problemsolving instinct also creates a number of followup problems and networking systemsincluding future selfdriving networks are not immune to this tendency 40 systems thinking can help us anticipate and avoid the negative consequences of wellintentioned solutions this can be done both prospectively by anticipating unintended consequences during strategic planning or retrospectively by understanding more deeply the nonobvious causes of existing chronic complex social problems 3 system misbehavior archetypes system dynamics literature is rife with examples of fixes gone wrongin which wellintentioned commonsense interventions to mitigate a particular problem has gone on to aggravate it not to mention the creation of other problems 44 peter senge the author of the bestselling systems thinking book 44 devised a list of system laws generalized from manifestations of commonly observed system behavior in diverse settings and many of these laws are somber reminders of how systems can misbehave and how solutions can themselves create new problems some of senges laws most pertinent to our work are 1 todays problems come from yesterdays solutions 2behavior grows better before it grows worse ie benefits of quickfix interventions accrue in the shorttime only to neutralize and worsen off in the long run 3 the easy way out usually leads back in 4 the cure can be worse than the disease ie shortterm improvements can lead to longterm dependencies 5 cause and effect are not closely related in time and space and 6 small changes can produce big resultsbut the areas of highest leverage are often the least obvious2 we term these generalizable pitfalls as archetypes this sec tion will detail some of the broadly applicable system archetypes and discuss how they might apply to networking in general and to selfdriving networks in particular these archetypes are easily understood and once internalized can help designers and stake holders in identifying the rut they are in and to identify recognizable paths the leverage points that can adopted for a resolution these system failure archetypes are listed in table 2 along with some networking examples due to the shortage of space these are not always elaborated upon in text 31 fixes that backfire this system archetype is associated with the concept of unintended consequences fixes that backfire are characterized by the use of a quick fix to reduce a problem symptom that works in the short run but at the cost of longterm consequences which people often fail to see due to long system delays this is a common pitfall in networks with some networking examples including 1 increasing queue buffers to decrease packet loss but instead causing bufferbloat 14 and 2 introducing additional links to an existing system only to see overall performance drop braess paradox 24 32 shifting the burden this archetype is associated with the concept of unintended de pendence this arises from dependence on a quick fix which is resorted to when the more fundamental solution is too expensive or too difficult to be implemented this archetype differs from fixes that backfire since the fundamental solution may not be ap parent or applicable in the latter with the shifting the burden 2due to the lack of space we omit explanations of these laws and refer interested readers to 44 3on analyzing selfdriving networks a systems thinking approach selfdn 2018 august 24 2018 budapest hungary table 2 system archetypes identified in system dynamics 44 with networking examples no archetype name description networking examples 1 fixes that backfire a quick solution with unexpected longterm consequences 23 25 14 24 ip nat 2 limits to growth improvement accelerates and then suddenly stalls ipv4 41 18 3 success to the successful things get better for winners and worse for losers 4 16 4 shifting the burden systems unconsciously favor shortterm addictive solutions 23 5 tragedy of the commons shared unmanaged resource collapses due to overconsumption 8 17 6 escalation different parties take actions to counter a perceived threat 35 7 7 eroding goals shortterm solutions lead to the deterioration of longterm goals 7 archetype the quick fix produces temporary relief by treating the symptoms which tends to reduce the motivation to implement the more fundamental solution the best example is seen in network capacity planning where operators would rather overdimension the network than implement more complex longterm solutions 33 limits to growth this archetype describes the concept of unanticipated constraints based on the insight that no physical system can sustain growth indefinitely any engine of growth however successful will in evitably be constrained by internal and external bottlenecks and constraints eg meadows 32 showed that we cannot sustainably support perpetual growth in a finite world this is a longstanding worry in communications networks for example researchers are now exploring how a permanent energy crisis scenarios may fun damentally limit our ability to maintain the currentday internet architecture and what our response should be in such an eventuality 41 39 34 success to the successful this archetype is associated with the concept of the winner takes it all it refers to the common tendency in social systems for the priv ileged to accumulate more of the benefits than the underprivileged this archetype commonly occurs in system dynamics and helps to make differences in privileges more pronounced over time for the purpose of selfdriving networks this archetype has implications for policy making for network neutrality and for ensuring fair re source allocation for example as major corporations eg google facebook control increasing portions of the internets content and infrastructure it seems likely that longterm competition might be crowded out this would potentially lead to an internet designed around the few rather than the many 35 eroding goals this archetype also called drifting goals is another easily recog nized system archetype it is a special case of shifting the burden where the preferred quick fix is to repeatedly lower the system goals this continuous adjustment then turns out to be fatal for the sys tem as it fails to fulfill its original design purpose in networks this sometimes happens in emerging markets where initial deployment expectations are curtailed by economic considerations 9 36 escalation this system archetype describes the story of unintended prolifer ation in a sort of an arms race in which the harder you push the harder the adversary pushes back many examples can be taken from network security where the attempts by applications to en crypt their traffic is responded to by adversaries upskilling their monitoring technologies eg fingerprinting encrypted webpages37 tragedy of the commons perhaps the most famous archetype this refers to the concept of a depleting shared resource that all parties are interested in exploit ing but none feel responsible for maintaining for networking this is applicable for unlicensed use of natural shared limited resources such as radio spectrumeg the problem of interference in un licensed wireless commons 30 it was also commonly reported in peertopeer file sharing applications where users would avoid sharing upload capacity 22 4 applying systems thinking in selfdriving networks in this section we begin to explore how systems thinking may be applied to selfdriving networks in particular we propose a system diagram or systemigram of selfdriving networks in section 41 and discuss various considerations for improving system structure in section 42 41 systemigram of selfdriving networks to illustrate how system thinking concepts may be applied in the context of selfdriving networks we use a systemigram a port manteau combining the two words system anddiagram shown in figure 1 the ultimate goal of systems thinking is to improve the understanding of systems predicting their behaviors and devising modifications in order to produce desired effects the journey towards this goal starts with understanding the system structure oval 1 in figure 1 which includes recognizing the interconnects between system components identifying the feedback between the various entities and identifying all the stake holders this understanding of the structure will help us understand the dynamic behaviors of the underlying system oval 2 the complex system dynamics can be modeled oval 3 using tools such as stock and flow diagrams and behavior over time graphs 26 the systems nonlinear behavior can be also understood by modeling the causeeffect relationship among the variables and fixed entities in the network system using tools such as causal loop diagrams system dynamics tool allow us to simulate system models which can be used to test out the efficiency of various policies or interventions oval 4 it is worth noting that selfdriving networks do not capture a single system but can be thought of as multiple interacting systems in which one system may be a subsystem of a larger system systems thinking is all about expanding horizons and seeing the big picture of how the system interacts with other systems which mutually influence each other therefore the next stage is emphasizing an understanding of the system at various scales oval 5 following these steps will improve our capability of identifying systems predicting their behaviors identifying relevant system 4selfdn 2018 august 24 2018 budapest hungary yaqoob et al systems thinking in sdn starts with 1a recognizing interconnects1b

selfdriving networks archetypes and devising modifications to them in order to produce desired effects in selfdriving networks 42 improving system structure this section will briefly discuss certain key things that should be understood when designing selfdriving networks again we take inspiration from systems thinking in identifying these considera tions 421 tussles conflicts and dilemmas first it must be kept in mind that different stakeholders on the internet ecosystem have different often conflicting interests which when independently pursued create tussles of various types for example some people wish for privacy on the internet others prefer accountability and the ability to identify behaviors some protocols aim to implement a functionality in an endtoend manner others may prefer an innetwork mechanism the functionality implemented at various layers may be neutralized or may even conflict when designing a selfdriving network we must be clear on which conflicts are being managed within each design decision thus there is not a single happy family of people on the inter net with aligned goals 7 apart from tussles and conflicts internet protocols and applications also often face dilemmas in which the goals of the subsystem and the overall system conflict one of the major insights of systems thinking is that the best way to optimize a system is not to independently optimize each subsystem but to optimize the relationships among the parts which often is the bot tleneck an important implication for selfdriving networks is that we cannot be everything to everyoneit becomes important to clearly articulate our goals while keeping in view that different sub systems do not have homogeneous interests or pointsofview wecan also use systems thinking tools to anticipate the nonobvious interactions between the subsystems and use insights therefrom to minimize tussles and bottlenecks 422 on architecting goals for networks interventions that aim to optimize parameters are nowhere as powerful as interventions that aim at changing the systems goals and paradigms 31 to ensure better performance we need clearer articulation of what the goals of our selfdriving networks are we argue that these goals should be enshrined in formal declarative languages that are common across diverse stakeholders through these it becomes possible for systems engineers to reason over their design decisions for example it makes it possible to identify conflicting goals as well as key tradeoffs between them 423 focusing on system bottlenecks a systems performance is never the sum of the performance of its parts but the product of their interactions to improve system performance bottlenecks should be identified and efforts should be invested in alleviating these bottlenecks rather than on optimizing subsystems separately for example it is well known that control loops within content delivery networks and internet service providers can conflict eg redirection strategies within a content delivery network may nega tively impact the load balancing strategies of the network opti mizing these two subsystems separately is far less beneficial than improving their interactions 38 in addition to identifying the problematic connections ie bottlenecks selfdriving networks could also leverage systems thinking to determine new types of interactions that could mitigate bottlenecks through more efficient information sharing 13 doing so in an integrated way might address problems faced when deploying past collaborative mecha nisms eg alto 5 5on analyzing selfdriving networks a systems thinking approach selfdn 2018 august 24 2018 budapest hungary unfortunately these control loops can suffer from significant timing delays in most networks sharing of information is limited to standard protocol exchange eg bgp less conventional data sharing occurs within a period of days typically manually this means that relevant information may not be available to the de cision maker when required this is particularly problematic in selfdriving which may rely on secondbysecond updates to facil itate the required timely sharing of information new architectures and strategies such as split control architectures are needed 19 5 challenges in devising selfdriving networks the previous section has identified key opportunities and ap proaches to designing selfdriving networks finally we now look at key open questions and challenges that remain as ripe areas of research 51 finding the right functional split despite the moniker of selfdriving networks humans will not be removed completely from the management of networks there will inevitably be a functional split between humans and computers for network management it is true that algorithms can prevent many trivial manual mistakes but it is worth keeping in mind that algorithms are also not impervious to blunders 29 since algorithms do not have the common sense and can only learn from the given instructions or data with it being well known that human intuition is sometimes marvelous and sometimes flawed 21 an important and not entirely technical exercise is to map the boundary conditions for the management of selfdriving networks where we can safely relegate matters and operations to algorithms and where we will like to have human oversight eg in crafting policies related to matters pertaining to ethics and human subjects there will likely be many configurations of selfdriving networks and more debate is needed on the right functional splitespecially to avoid reliability security and ethics related problems 52 ethical challenges giving away the agency of decisionmaking to algorithms in self driving networks opens up a plethora of ethical challenges despite the many successes of machine learning ml experts have pointed out that many modern ml techniques work like a blackbox and may make predictions without really knowing why the harm ful effects of opaque unregulated mlbased algorithms described by oneil in 37 represent a significant concern for selfdriving networks in 10 an example of an mlbased spam filter was pro posed using features such as the autonomous system number of the sender although very useful one should reason ahead about the potential of false positives and take steps to ensure that we do not inadvertently create weapons of math destruction or strengthen existing stereotypes 37 50 we believe that systems thinking can help us perform higher order thinking and determine unintended consequences of relying on opaque ml algorithms and potentially biased datasets the question of agency ie who will take the ethical decision also looms large for selfdriving networks it is not clear if network operators and managers should make ethical decisions on behalf of the uses and if so then how these ethical questions may not have an objectively straightforward resolution and present dilemmaseg selfdriving network version of trolley problems 36 may arise in which the interest of many might be vying with the actions of a limited few and one has to decide how this conflict is to be addressed an example would be where a selfconfigured network chooses to block certain ip ranges to curtail a perceived dos attack whilst also impacting regular users the ethical decisions adopted may also have strong social and economic implications as the policy may be beneficial for some stakeholders but not for others furthermore changes in incentives may trigger changes in the services and products the clients will use we believe that systems thinking can allow us to rigorously study these ripple effects in selfdriving networks ethical concerns related to networking research are now being documented and guiding principles articulated 220 but specific ethical concerns around selfdriving networks require more deliberations 53 security challenges as remarked tellingly by russell ackoff",

widely adopted in selforganizing networks son for automating differ ent networking tasks recently it has been shown that dnn lack robustness against adversarial examples where an adversary can fool the dnn model into incorrect classification by introducing a small imperceptible perturbation to the original example son is expected to use dnn for multiple fundamental cellular tasks and many dnnbased solutions for performing son tasks have been proposed in the literature have not been tested against adversarial examples in this paper we have tested and explained the robustness of son against adversarial example and investigated the performance of an important son use case in the face of adversarial attacks we have also generated explanations of incorrect classifications by utilizing an explainable artificial intelligence ai technique index termsadversarial machine learning self organizing cellular networks i i ntroduction driven by ambitious bandwidth and latency targets and the development of new domains such as iot and connected vehi cles 5g networks are becoming increasingly complex as they incorporate disparate emerging trends such as network densi fication and coexistence with existing cellular technologies these networks also perform several challenging activities such as planning dimensioning deployment testing network optimization comprehensive performance monitoring failure detection failure correction and general maintenancewhich currently utilize large human resources in the loop this results in a network that is both costlythus dissatisfying for the cellular operator and errorpronebringing customer dissatisfaction and resulting in increased churn 1 in such scenarios artificial intelligence ai driven self organized networks provides an attractive alternative by providing the tools for performing automation with self organization and intelligence the main objectives of the son are to build an intelligent network that can guarantee the net work resilience with reduced complexity simplified network management and properly optimized network configurations 2 son technology leverages advance in machine learning ml and deep learning dl techniques to overcome the multiple challenges of operating modern network through their integral capability of handling and analyzing big data even though ml and dl models can greatly outperform traditional methods in obtaining excellent accuracy in benign environments it is also important to verify the robustness ofthese models in adversarial settings particularly since it has been shown in recent work that adversarial examples can be generated by malicious adversaries to fool the dl models very easily by applying small perturbations to the original inputs 3 4 more formally an adversarial sample xis created by following the equation 1 where imperceptible perturbation is denoted as legitimate test example is denoted as x the deployed trained classifier is described by f andtdescribes the wrong class adversary wants to achieve xx arg min xfkkfx tg 1 deep neural networks dnn work in a black box manner and this lack of transparency can be a major drawback for the security critical domains hence explainable ai xai or blackbox model interpretability plays an important part in mitigating this threat of adversaries tomsett et al 5 proposed this phenomenon that xai and adversarial machine learning aml are conceptually linked and insights into one ot them can provide insights into the other this is because most vulnerable features after adversarial attacks together with the help of xai and aml can be identified and ulti mately any relevant defensive technique can be applied this interpretability becomes more important now because of the recent adaptation of explainable ai at government levels like general data protection regulation gdpr1 which expresses the importance of explanations of the logic involved when automated decision making takes place 6 the main contributions of our work are experimentally validated the impact of adversarial attacks in the domain of son demonstrated that the explainable ai and adversarial ml are linked with each other and adversarial ml can be used to describe feature representations of a dnn model to the best of our knowledge this study is first in the domain of son to test adversarial machine

and provides future directions ii r elated work a son to provide best cellular services to the endusers efficient network optimization is a continuous process of planning parametric configuration changes operations and maintenance with the help of large human interventions therefore the son is introduced as an intelligent network that provides scalability agility and stability to maintain the operators and consumers desired objectives 7 a fundamental property of the son is the ability to interact and learn from the networking environment to adapt to the changing circumstances three main functions of son selfconfiguration self healing and selfoptimization perform these automatic tasks 8 selfconfiguration manages tasks of automatic configura tion of cellular network nodes the main use cases are plan ning and modifying the radio and transport parameters self optimization manages solutions that target cellular network performance optimization based on the operator specifications the main use cases of this category are handover parameters optimization qosrelated parameters optimization and load balancing whereas selfhealing manages tasks to automatic detection and rectification of failures in network in the context of cellular systems dnns are applied in all three categories of son feng et al 9 used dnn to implement cell outage detection daroczy et al 10 used ml to predict radio access bearer rab sessions drops well before the end of the session other important work for son in cellular networks using dnn include resource optimization 11 and mobility management 12 recently chen et al 13 combined adversarial training with variational autoencoders to unsupervised learning the behavior of abnormal kpi on the internet an adversary can affect dnn models of son through internal and external attacks in the case of internal attacks adversaries can corrupt training data and classifiers of dnn models of son directly however these internal attacks are not easily possible due to the difficult task of adding adver sarial examples directly into the input of the dnn model whereas external attacks can utilize vulnerabilities of data collection process of cellular networks base stations collect measurement reports and pass it son function that uses this collected data to implement its different functionalities for network optimization adversarial examples can be injected into this data collection process with the help of a rogue base station shaik et al 14 demonstrated the security vul nerabilities of sonenabled lte networks they injected thefake data into the son ecosystem with the help of a rogue base station there work is mainly concerning dos attacks on cellular networks and user devices b adversarial attacks on sons and cognitive networks most of the current research of adversarial machine learning is relevant to computer vision tasks such as szegedy et al 3 shows that deep neural network can change its prediction by using nonrandom perturbation in its inputs these changes are imperceptible due to the extremely low probability of negative adversaries in every test set goodfellow et al 4 and papernot et al 15 extended this initial study and proposed fast gradient sign method fgsm and jacobianbased saliency map attack jsma respectively for generating adversarial examples fgsm is a technique for crafting an adversarial example where one step gradient update is performed in the direction of the sign associated with the gradient at each feature in the test example the fgsm perturbation is given as signrxjxl 2 whereas jsma is based on the concept of saliency maps this algorithm tries to find input dimensions or features that are most vulnerable due to possible perturbations by creating a saliency map and an iterated process to find misclassification in the model jx fx x fjx xi 3 some recent studies of adversarial examples are performed in the field of network intrusion detection systems nids in these studies significant degradation in accuracy is ob served for intrusion detection systems after exposing dnns to adversarial examples 16 whereas usama et al 17 investigated the vulnerability of cognitive self organizing networks cson utilizing mldl techniques against adver sarial attacks in this study we have performed fgsm and jsma attack on dnnbased abnormal kpi detector to show that adversarial attacks can be fatal for this important use case of son c adversarial defense methods many methods have been proposed for making ml models more robust and mitigating adversarial examples adversarial training 4 and defensive distillation 18 are two famous de fense techniques we have implemented adversarial training as a defensive technique for our experiments the basic idea of adversarial training is to train the model using adversarial examples and assign the same labels of the original examples to the adversarial examples d explainable ai current work of explainable ai or blackbox model inter

possible outcomes whereas local interpretability is used to generate an individual explanation to justify why the model made a specific decision for an instance 19 some recent studies explored the link between xai and aml tomsett et al 5 proposed this phenomenon that xai and adversarial machine learning aml are conceptually linked and insights in one can provide insights in the other domain

multitude of languages spoken globally 75 to rectify the limitations observed in vision body language and speechbased emotion recognition systems scholarly literature proposes the adoption of multimodal approaches 139 these approaches advocate for the simultaneous analysis of video and audio inputs harnessing the powerful synergy between facial displays and paralinguistic speech features by incorporating both modalities as shown in figure 8 a more resilient and accurate emotion recognition system can be achieved particularly when confronted with intricate or amalgamated emotions in realworld scenarios this multimodal strategy enriches the emotional context by surpassing the confines of a solitary input type thereby enhancing the overall efficacy of the recognition process 139 b securing eim against adversarial attacks research has shown challenges in designing robust affec tive computing systems due to adversarial examples which demonstrate deep model vulnerability to imperceptible pertur bations 75 140 prominent attacks craft perturbation noise guided by targeted output gradients including fast gradient sign method 141 jacobianbased saliency map attack 142 and deepfool 143 affective computing systems are also susceptible to such attacks 140 144 attack success underscores lack of robustness in dl model representations as described by li et al 145 they proposed a robust detectiondeactivation method for adversaries in eim their method can restrict and separate access of potential malicious participants meaning it can block vulnerable backpropagation and gan attacks the motivation was drawn from anomaly detection systems though presenting a potential solution an adaptive adversary can learn this behaviour and modify attack vectors to inject eim model vulnerabilities this shows adversarial attacks significantly threaten affective computing in eim malicious actors can manipulate input to deceive emotion models enabling incorrect responses or unauthorised access to sensitive user emotions attacks can undermine trust compromise privacy and enable harm to counter susceptibility training dl models to generate robust representations against transformations has been explored 146 147 notably very deep architectures demonstrated ser robustness yet further exploration is needed into what dl models capture from speech and how to define adversarial examples without adversary knowledge",

stochas tic models for continuously evolving emotional states and dynamics the nonstationarity and longcontext dependence inherent in emotional expressions pose significant challenges when it comes to modelling and interpretation traditional approaches may struggle to capture the intricate nuances and the evolving relationship between different modalities used to convey various emotions over time in eim 166 to address these complexities a multimodel integrated solution is necessary such a solution should be capable of understanding and incorporating the nuances and dynamics of emotional expressions within eim 166 167 by integrating multiple models that account for various modalities including facial expressions body language voice tone and other contextual cues we can strive for a

previously 9 wav2vec2 when initialised randomly showed performance comparable to cnn lstm however models like xlsr whisper and mms which are pretrained on massive multilanguage datasets demonstrate improved performance in crosslanguage ser compared to wav2vec2 trained on singlelanguage data the distinct advantage underscores the significance of diverse pretraining datasets in elevating the capabili ties of speech models for finetuning tasks adapting the foundation models with a few target lan guage samples resulted in substantial gains over the base line demonstrating their ability to

eliminates the overhead of periodic active clustering by timerbased cluster mainten ance moreover as the maximum velocity of the vehicles increases the increase in the clustering overhead of nhop and mdmac is steeper than that of vmasc which illustrates the stability of vmasc in highly dynamicnetworks furthermore the clustering overhead of the protocols increases as the maximum number of hops

the success probability of the transmissions the reason for the superior performance of the clusteringbased hybrid architectures over pure clusteringbased data forwarding and pure flooding on the other hand is the efficiency of ltebased communication among clusters in hybrid architectures hybrid archi tecture decreases the number of transmissions in the ieee 80211pbased network by providing ltebased interclustercommunication which in turn decreases the mediumaccess contention moreover the dpdr of vmasclte does not considerably change when the m aximum velocity increasesucar et al

target geographical area of disseminationfigs 11 and 12 show the average and maximum delay of different algorithms at different maximum velocities for one two and threehopbased clustering mechanisms respectively when we consider these results together with fig 9 we observe that there is a tradeoff between dpdr and delay for flooding and pure clusterbased algorithms flooding provides lower delay than clusterbased algorithms whereas clusterbased algorithms achieve a higher dpdr than flooding lte based hybrid architectures on the other hand achieve both low delay and high dpdr at the cost of using the infrastructure among the hybrid architectures vmasclte achieves the lowest delay furthermore the dpdr and delay analysis atdifferent numbers of maximum hops allowed within clusters shows that increasing the maximum number of hops increases the dpdr at the cost of slight increase in the delay 3 lte cost the lte cost metric indicates the cost of using lte infrastructure to improve the data delivery performance of the hybrid architecture and is measured by the number of chs in the network the number of chs depends on both the number of hops used in the clustering algorithm and the constraint onthe maximum number of membe rs that ch and cm can admit which is denoted by member chandmember cm respectively we assume that the value of member ch varies from 1 to 10 however the value

there exists a lot of contention around the ch this results in the loss of packets around the ch and thus loss of connectionsto the parent node in the routing path to the ch when the connection of a vehicle to its parent node breaks the vehicle and all of its children transition back to the se state thus increasing the clustering overhead further and possibly creating an unnecessarily higher number of clusters fig 13 shows the dependence of the dpdr on member chfor different numbers of maximum allowedhops we observe that the dpdr increases up to 100 as member chdecreases the main reason for this behavior is the decrease in the clustering overhead and contentionin the ieee 80211pbased network with the decrease in member ch this demonstrates the adaptive usage of the vmasclte architecture depending on the reliability requirement of the application as the reliability requirement of the application increases the value of the member ch parameter needs to decrease at the cost

due to the disconnected network and broadcast storm problems respectively the lte based hybrid architecture however improves the performance greatly providing a high dpdr that is stable at all vehicle traffic densities moreover despite the tradeoff between dpdr and delay observed for flooding and pure clusterbased algorithms the proposed architecture has been demonstratedto achieve both low delay and high dpdr at the cost of using the lte infrastructure among the hybrid architectures vmasclte achieves the lowest delay and highest dpdr due to better clustering stability minimal clustering overhead and minimal overlap among clusters the dpdr and delay analysis at different numbers of maximum hops allowed within clusters shows that increasing the maximum number of hops up to three increases the dpdr at the cost of slight increase in the delay we have also defined the lte cost metric as the cost of using lte infrastructure to improve the data delivery performance of the hybrid architecture the lte cost is measured by the number of chs in the network we observe that the dpdr increases up to 100 as the number of members allowed in theclusters decreases the main reason for this behavior is the decrease in the clustering overhead and contention in the ieee80211pbased network with the decrease in the number of cms this demonstrates the adaptive usage of the vmasclte architecture depending on the reliability requirement of the application as the required reliability of the application in creases the number of cms needs to decrease at the cost ofcreating a larger number of clusters thus increasing the cost of lte usage as future work we aim to investigate the use of vmasc lte in urban traffic scenarios and extend the vmasclte architecture with data aggrega

to another place nicola tesla modern wireless and data communication systems are a combination of different distributed architectures which involves many underlying applications technologies and networking policies the fifth generation of communication technology is expected by the year 2020 with this new networking generation different allied networking and computational regimes such as the internet of things pervasive computing ubiquitous computing approximates computing and approximate networking is expected to contribute in building towards the network of everything cost of computing and networking hardware is expected to decay exponentially and with that networking cost also decays rapidly this massive transition and new networking regimes have got research community to think of new alternative networking designs for wireless and data communication in this section we will briefly introduce and discuss the issues in previous and current networking architecture we will also provide a list of problems in current networking architecture this section will also include the social and economic challenges for next generation networking architecture a design evolution of wireless data communication networks 1 legacy wireless communication network legacy networking architecture lacks the ability of cog nition they usually follow a strict rulebased policy in determining the allocation of spectrum resources identification of transmission channel interference temperature and many other network related information these rulebased systems initially work fine for a small set of users with limited quality of service qos requirements but as the wireless network grows in the number of users and their service requirements these strict rulebased systems with no cognition ability were not able to deliver the optimal performance the major reason for this failure lies in the ossification of the network design which did not allow the transmitter and receiver to learn from the dynamic environment and results in bad network performance poor qos and wastage of network resources2 2 crosslayer wireless networking communication systems were designed in a strict layered approach where each layer performed prespecified tasks and follows strict layering principals to perform these prespecified tasks the major shortcoming of this design was the lack of the operational information dissemination to other layers which is a major hindrance in fulfilling the necessary architectural design requirements of wireless communication system another reason for this failure was the timevarying nature of the wireless channel to overcome these issues a crosslayer designing approach for wireless network was used where joint optimization of networking protocols across different layers and improved coordination among different layers was introduced fundamentally crosslayer wireless network architectures are based on sharing the knowledge of physical and media access control mac layer of the wireless channel with the layers above them this information sharing solves the critical problem of resource allocation in wireless networking the major problem with this design approach is its lack of dynamic behavior adaption of the wireless network user diversity and different qos demands of users and this lack of adaption has a negative effect on the tradeoff between performance and interoperability 3 cognition based networking the rapid expansion of the wireless communication and the internet has resulted in a complex heterogeneous design which requires the network to be capable of dynamically adapting from the surroundings for intelligent resource allocation and interoperability the ossified legacy layered network design and the stringently bounded crosslayer architecture are not able to meet the diverse needs of the new era of wireless communication systems to meet these challenges the idea of cognition is taken from psychology and implemented in wireless communication network design this new paradigm was named as cognitive radios a spectrum access utilization before moving ahead with cognitive radios we need to mention another major issue which causes the diversion from crosslayer design to a more intelligent cognition based design this issue is known as spectrum access and utilization the electromagnetic spectrum is a scarce natural resource regulated by governments the expected exponential growth in connected devices and proposed small densely connected topologies for upcoming communication systems will have a disruptive effect on spectrum allocation and utilization similarly rapid growth in the adaption of new communication technologies and reduced cost of access for personal and corporate use has raised serious questions about the availability and utilization of electromagnetic spectrum federal communications commission fcc published a report in 2002 which is considered to be a very first document reviewing the 90 years of spectrum allocation and usage this report characterized the potential issues in electromagnetic spectrum allocation and usage 1 utilization of electromagnetic spectrum is biased in terms of occupancy of frequency bands in the spectrum when we sweep the whole frequency spectrum few frequency bands are vacant most of the time few are partially loaded and rest of them are heavily loaded this uneven distribution of frequency bands usage causes underutilization of the electromagnetic spectrum according to the fcc report underutilization of the electromagnetic spectrum will be the most significant problem in future communication systems underutilization of electromagnetic spectrum occurs due to two major causes namely traditional command and control procedures andfixed spectrum assignment policy this underutilization leads to a phenomenon known as spectrum holes a spectrum hole is caused when the primary user a primary user is the one which buys the license form the regulatory body and regulatory body assigns a frequency spectrum for a geographical area for a mutually decided time to which a certain frequency band is assigned for a certain time does not utilize it completely in 1999 mitola et al 2 proposed a solution to this fixed spectrum assignment policy by utilizing the spectrum holes for secondary users users with no spectrum license opportunistically this policy is known as dynamic spectrum access dsa opportunistic behavior involves sensing the surrounding environment and adapting to the statistical variations to extract the best possible result this sensing reasoning and adapting behavior is known as cognitive behavior by incorporating cognitive behavior mitola et al 3 in the year 2000 purposed a new paradigm of intelligent wireless communication systems called cognitive radios which has the ability of sensing the statistical changes in incoming radio frequency signals and making corresponding changes in certain network operating parameters this reasoning and adaptive behaviour3 has two primary objectives highly reliable communication whenever and whereever needed andefficient utilization of frequency spectrum cognitive radios introduced a sensing and reconfiguring approach in networking but this design approach has some serious issues like detection of weak signals from primary users before sharing the spectrum with the secondary user it required a tighter control over the secondary user to avoid interference and this control has killed the whole idea of opportunistic networking to solve this issue a new intelligent sensing algorithm along with customized transceiver was required another major challenge is to manage the tradeoff between the censored radius of the primary user and interference power to avoid the shadowing similarly dynamic nature of wireless channel and diverse qos demands needed a revised rate and capacity adaption algorithms for cognitive radios to work cognitive radios proved to be a much better design than previous crosslayer or legacy wireless designs but due to aforementioned flaws in cognitive radios design it was not very successful but it paved a path towards intelligent wireless networking b design challenges for next generation of wireless data communication networks now lets take a look on the issues in current wireless and data network designs heterogeneity com plexity and dynamic nature are the three fundamental properties of next communication generation the communication architecture and the internet were not designed to fulfill these properties with the emergence of new technologies such as the internet of things multicore architectures and exponential social adaption of these new technologies have rapidly increased the complexity of the wireless communication systems this has also increased the qos bar for the applications to meet the qoe of the users with all these new technologies wireless communication and the internet have become a bounded closed loop system with multiple tradeoffs and restriction to avoid multiple performance issues but now these strict policies have become a bottleneck in designing nextgeneration communication systems 1 network management as mentioned earlier there is an exponential increase in new innovative ap plications of the internet and wireless communication technologies but we are lagging behind in network management and this is very alarming given the expected number of connected devices and their diverse nature network management has lagged behind in innovation curve because of fundamental strict bounded internet and wireless communication system design to meet the challenges of nextgeneration communi cation systems and connectivity requirements we need to think a new selforganized network management systems 2 field of view of protocols wireless networks and the internet employs multiple protocols to make communication between transmitter and receiver possible these protocols are limited in their field of view and information sharing abilities with the complete network whenever we need to integrate a new system we introduce a protocol in the software and then keep on updating the protocols to fix the raised issues due to variable network conditions users qoe and security reasons although we employee all these fixes still we are lagging behind in user qoe applications qos security etc this is because the problem does not lie in protocols it lies in the protocols limited field of view and their inability to model holistic network systems due to shortcomings the operators are not able to have a complete picture of what is happening in the network this causes multiple technical issues at the operator which also reflects on consumers qoe although network function virtualization softwaredefined networking and centralized control have offered a solution of the protocol problem but apple does not the apple doesnt fall far from the tree these schemes have their shortcomings and these shortcomings have their basis in rule based switching of sdn and closed form of networking so in order to design nextgeneration networks we need to increase the field of view of a network protocol and rethink the restriction on the coordination among the networking protocols 3 measurement quantification measurement and quantification process of the wireless communi cation systems and the internet is of critical importance it is used for network planning and resource allocation this process is usually decoupled from network control and performed offline and this is a major shortcoming in current network design since most of the next generation networks are considered4 to be selforganized they need measurement and quantification process to be realtime and distributed to get a better view of network statistics to make an intelligent decision 4 knowledge base current wireless communication and data network architectures mostly use rule based or threshold based decisionmaking strategies for their operation automation recommendation and troubleshooting process very few applications such as sdn employees artificial intelligence ai for decision making when we consider designing a nextgeneration communication network this lack of adaption of intelligent machine learning techniques in current wireless and data communication networks is a very alarming problem the adaption of ai in networking along with centralized control and strong network analytics forms a knowledge base and provides the ability of realtime inference which is a fundamental property of selfdriven future networks 5 tussles current networking architecture has a distinctive perhop behavior for example routing there are many parties involved in how to perhop behavior should look like these parties have their own agenda or function that they need to fulfill these agenda can be aligned to the network overall function or these agenda have an adverse nature to optimize the network behavior to its own advantage without caring much about the overall system this property is termed as tussle 4 tussles have its basis in different social political conflicting interests biased users preferences internet service providers isp monopoly topological conflicts competitive nature of the current networking business etc these tussles will act as key enablers for rethinking the current networking architecture to support the future networking business 6 operators wishes the service provider or operator in current wireless and data network architecture is responsible for all the network planning decision making configuration operation maintenance and measurement quantification given the number of tasks and the expected number of connected devices in near future this becomes a design flaw we can leverage the advancement of machine learning formal methods programming languages big data genetic algorithms approximate computing and approximate networking to offload the operator by introducing a sensing collecting adapting and reconfiguring property in the network devices and the end users 7 routing routing is a core part of any communication network which provides the information flow in inter and intraautonomous networks these routing and forwarding algorithms are built on a strict non adaptive policy which causes inefficient resource utilization routing and most of the network components follow strict rules this is because communication and data networks were not initially thought of as dynamic systems future communication networks are considered to be heterogeneous complex and dynamic so to meet the requirements of the future networks a new selfaware and organized routing policy is needed 8 security another aspect of current networks which will be a major concern in designing the future network design is security the security in wireless and data networks is ensured by using hardware firewalls encryption techniques and thirdparty inclusion the major goal of security in the current design is to make the best security possible to avoid any breach but best security is not the perfect security best security solutions which include a combination of encryption and anonymization makes operators job of network management more tedious we need to revisit the tradeoff between security and network management cognitionbased solution by developing an intelligent model using the big data produced by the network can form a sustainable security solution which not only satisfies the privacy concerns of the consumers but also makes network security management possible 9 optimization premature optimization is the root of all evil donald knuth in current network architecture network administrator or network controller in case of sdn performs networking parameters optimization operation to meet the diverse user demands and dynamic channel conditions current networking architecture has a complex multi feedback loop alike architecture and this property limits the field of view of the administrator or controller and results in premature optimization this kind of optimization causes a disruptive effect on overall networking architecture5 10 signalling overhead a very imminent threat for the next generation of communication networks is the signaling overhead this is a concern due to a large number of connected communication devices forming a heterogeneous architecture to overcome this threat a new alternative intelligent signaling design is required for future networks 11connectivity vs data rate in upcoming years embedded devices will cost less than one dollar and the number of connected devices will increase exponentially this will cause a unique problem where instead data rate connectivity will become a major problem future networking architectures must be able to deal with this issue intelligently by making a smart connectivity policy 12compromises tradeoffs the current wireless and data communication network design is a combi nation of many tradeoffs restrictions and bounds which is a problem when it comes to building a dynamic network architecture these compromises are made to enforce a strict policy to ensure better resource allocation improved resource utilization optimal network performance and security the outcome of these compromises is not as they were expected instead of producing optimal results in terms of avoiding breakdowns security breaches information loss interference and congestion these strict rules has proven to be shortcomings in designing a dynamic future networking architecture hardware and protocol design tradeoff latency throughput tradeoff the transmission rate restriction the minimum and maximum frame size bound in tcpip stack etc are the few examples of the compromises that need to be revisited and improved for building an intelligent selfdriven network c social economic challenges two fundamental driving forces that had played an important role in the success of wireless and data networks are social needs and economic growth these enablers are expected to be important components of future networks since the social and economic aspect of current networking architecture are key enablers they are also considered as major challenges for future networks we will discuss these two daunting challenges in upcoming paragraphs 1 social challenges networking is not about connecting devices that share information it is about connecting people the internet and other communication networks were designed on the basic principle of sharing knowledge and meeting the social needs of the society as society evolves the networking has tried to adapt accordingly by introducing different ideas such as congestion controls to dedicated systems password protection to encrypted machines spam filtering to firewalls open network to regulated network etc given the social evolution these aforementioned ideas may not work for future networks for designing new networking architectures the research community has to look into these five funda mental social aspects i do we need to revisit the social human contract which talks about the political and moral evolution of the human with time ii do we need to provide cyber education to the community iii do we need to conduct social studies to learn about the communication demands and risks before developing new designs iv how to convince the community to utilize the network for economic activity v how to settle on a less strict tradeoff on censorship and privacy for keeping the idea of openness of internet alive 2 economic challenges the relationship between alternative networking architectures and economic viability is a very critical problem that has been ignored for too long in networking research the infrastruc ture cost is decaying so does the communication cost how to build an economically viable new networking architecture economic problem will act as the most important problem and overshadows all the issues given in ib 56 there are ten fundamental questions that needs to be answered before designing the new networking architecture i how to build an architecture that routes money packets are side effects ii how to deal with the fundamental tussle between isp and regulator to get to a solution of how to utilize the infrastructure iii how to achieve the optimal longevity by keeping the economic growth iv infrastructure should be owned by public sector or private v what are the incentive that can be offered to the private sector to keep them interested in investing the money vi there are about 5000 isps are they willing to invest in new architecture vii how can we design a viable economic plan for bringing in the money from consumer is building smart markets zero ratings and service specific billing a appropriate solution viii should we put the regulations on networks and give its control to the state authorities to ensure trust guarantees and certificates how this will affect the economic circle ix how to deal with local regulators x how to deal with the tussle between network cost and computing cost d rethinking the networking architecture given the problems associated with evolution of networking architectures and all the design flaws in current networking architecture along with social and economic issues current networking architecture will not be able to support the diverse needs of upcoming communication systems we need to rethink the networking architecture which has the following properties fit to its purpose secure resilient economically viable manageable intelligent self organizing and meet the needs of society design evolution flaws given in ia and issues in the current networking techniques provided in ib invites us to rethink the networking architecture in this paper we will try to provide an alternative design approach for meeting the challenges of next generation of communication networks by keeping in view the social and economic challenges mentioned in ic e organization of the report in this report we will discuss the a detailed review of all the key components of an alternative networking approach will be discussed which is based on improved cognition cycle section ii discuss the design flaws in the security section iii highlights the barriers to better security design section iv will provide basic details of new cognitive wireless network design and improved cognition cycle section v will conclude the report ii s ecurity in this section we have discussed the issues and challenges in security architecture employed in current internet and communication systems current internet architecture has a very poor security architecture it is a combination of many compromises and tradeoffs moreover",

        "prompt": "initial security design assumption were flawed we will discuss these assumption and present how these underlying assumption resulted in a bad security architecture but before that we need to look at the various definitions perspectives and players involved in current security design security in the internet and communication systems had multiple definitions and they are all right in their limited scope initially security was defined as a system which performs only prespecified tasks and avoid accepting or interacting with unsafe or vulnerable system this definition of security does not fulfill the needs of modern internet and communication systems this is because the internet or current communication systems have multipurpose and multifunctional characteristics prespecifying the tasks of these systems will limit the utilization of these systems and this is not desirable moreover there are many7 unspecified tasks of the internet and communication systems security architecture was not designed to meet these diverse tasks designing a security architecture for upcoming generation of the internet and communication systems will be a very big challenge consumers definition of security is very different from the aforementioned definition consumers do not care about the specifications technological advancement physical limitations of device etc they only require a security which has negligible probability of evasion this makes security designers task more difficult another important aspect which is also relates with the consumer security definition is the tradeoff between security and privacy it is a special case of the tussle between service provider and users this tradeoff has not been handled properly in current communication and internet design this section will also discuss the issues and perspective solutions related to security and privacy tradeoff another definition of security is influenced by the economics and politics where security is defined as a cost effective system which is not only used for defence but sometime use for offence different couturiers have different legal social and economic laws and they influence the security architecture by imposing different restrictions and censorship this biased approach has caused a serious concerns in security designing professionals designing the internet and communication system security by keep the incentive for the investors and following the regional policies is another tradeoff that designers have to deal with this section will also explains this important tradeoff this diverse nature of security definitions and related tradeoffs depicts that the initial goal of designing a general security solution was flawed and we need to reconsider the security architecture that can handle all the necessary security requirements of consumer service providers application developers and regional authorities to answer this question we need to understand two major concepts flaws in previous security design and attack characterization flaws in previous security design will provide the initial design perspective and limitation details attack characterization is a process of learning the attacks dynamic behaviour and analyze it to form a defence mechanism against it a flaws in current security architecture in this subsection we will discuss the flaws in the internet and communication system security design we will follow a layered approach to describe the flaws in security architecture 1 physical layer links routers server and many other related hardware constitute physical layer and it is highly vulnerable to the local and remote attacks using carefully crafted cyber tools and hardware this layer also contains hardware

physical layer security of wireless system is bounded by two major imperfection of wireless channel namely fading and pathloss there are other related wireless channel imperfections caused by nature but current physical layer security design was not developed by taking into account these wireless channel limitations there are many security solution proposed to ensure security of the physical layer these security solution are based on the coding theory key generation game theory information theory and many other statistical and rule based schemes if we look at the service model and functional specifications of the physical layer they are best effort and weak functional specifications respectively best effort and weak functional specification means that hardware can malfunction attacker can tape the channel for information statistical approximation can go wrong no service guarantees are offered to the users these weak underlying design assumptions are the core reason of a bad security design for the physical layer these weak assumption raise multiple unanswered questions like how to characterize the security how to decide on a physical layer security design given the exponential raise in connected devices in upcoming communication generation the security of physical layer is also related to the layers above how to ensure the security coordination8 another related shortcoming in current wireless communication systems and the internet which act as a limiting factor in designing an appropriate physical layer security is the concept of security as a service as mentioned at the start of the section that security has multiple dimensions and these dimensions will keep increasing as we get into the next generation of communication in current security design for physical layer the security is considered as a service where hardware is placed in secure facilities and many coding techniques combined with encrypted key generation with trust sharing is used all these security fixes are rule based threshold based and contextless because the service base defence mechanism assume a uniform threat model the major question here is how to develop a dynamic threat model given all the aforementioned shortcomings in physical layer security we need to rethink the physical layer security for next generation of communication systems we need to make the dynamic threat models along with intelligent coordination among the layers this dynamic and robust physical layer security can be achieved by rethinking the cognition cycle and building a trust hierarchy based cognitive solution for physical layer 2 data link layer data link layer is responsible of moving packets from network layers to the host many attacks has been performed and proposed in literature ranging from address resolution protocol poisoning to authentication attacks on the wireless users in wireless domain data link layer has faced many security challenges such as hidden node attacks fake access point attacks authentication attacks mac flooding mac spoofing port stealing vlan hopping etc security in network is as strong as the weakest link once the weakest link is compromised rest of the communication system will be compromised in wireless communication networks and the internet data link layer can be a weakest link this layer is considered a possible weak link of security because this layer is not only attacked by the external attacker but also faces the insider threat challenge where a rouge employee can share the insider information with the adversary wireless channel has its own characteristics and these are exploited by attackers in deploying data link denial of service attacks where clear to send and request to send messages are flooded in the system which ultimately results in degraded quality of service similarly deauthenticaion attack where deauth frame is spoofed by the attacker because of low security results in disassociation of the user from wireless access point this attacks depicts a fundamental security understanding flaw where the initializing frame security is compromised to ensure immediate connectivity another example of data link layer poor security is the fake access point attack this attack is performed by spoofing the wireless beacon frames and intelligently crafting similar adversarial beacons and flooding the network with these adversarial beacons for the purposes of denying the connectivity to the legitimate user all the attacks and shortcoming explained are resulted because the current wireless data link layer model is just an upgrade of the wired data link layer model with multiple compromises to ensure wireless connectivity and availability data link layer security lacks the dynamic adaption from surrounding environment due to its static design and this results in flawed security architecture for data link layer since next generation communication systems are expected to be self organized we need to reconsider the data link security we need to design data link security as a part of a trust based system which has the ability to defend against the adversarial and insider attacks 3 network layer network layer is responsible for packet forwarding and routing through intermediate networks this layer offers no service guarantees as it is based on best effort delivery this underlying service structure causes lack of trust and coordination issues in developing security of network layer for next generation of communication systems network layer security is designed using ipsec protocol where encryption strategies are used to provide data confidentiality and data integrity this security works well but putting more encryption to secure data is not a good approach because attacker information will also get encrypted this reduces the probability of attacker detection and increases the complexity of network traffic analysis at the service provider end another important task of network layer is routing the current routing algorithms are does not possess the ability to learn from previous abnormalities and also lacks in technical security control given the expected heterogeneity and complexity of the future network these rule based and policy compliant routing9 algorithms does not fulfill the routing requirements to solve this problem a new intelligent realtime traffic control scheme with trusted hierarchy support is required tang et al 6 has proposed a new real time deep learning based intelligent traffic control system this system is based on deep convolutional neural networks with unique input and output characterization for wireless mesh network backbone mao et al 7 also proposed an intelligent routing method for future networks by utilizing deep boltzmann machine algorithms these new schemes are using deep machine learning technique but they have not considered security perspective of the network layer all these architectures and designs have to face two major challenges namely trust hierarchy andmigration problem trust hierarchy is a scheme where communication entities uses trusted authentication mechanism via mutually shared like public key algorithm or trusted third party based authentication system in future intelligent communication system this trust based network layer protocol is still an open research problem switching to new routing schemes with trust based authentication scheme at once will be very difficult at the global scale this falls under the umbrella of social and economics problem we need a new social contract with economic incentives for the users and service providers to switch to this new secure intelligent scheme 4 transport layer transport layer is responsible for end to end communication in the network this layer provides logical communication between application process running on different hosts transport layer provides synchronized in order and guaranteed delivery with flow control and encrypted security previously it is possible to build a closed form tractable model of transport layer behavior because networks were simpler rule based and less diverse future communication systems are complex and heterogeneous building a closed form behavior model to predict the change in the network is not a tractable solution 8 current security architecture of transport layer largely dependent upon cryptographic algorithms cryp tography is a very powerful tool to ensure security but given the scale of the future networks this solution will become a hazard due to expected diverse security needs in future internet and wireless communication systems as we increase the number of devices complex connectivity and multiple levels of security requirements cryptographic algorithms turns all the attacks on the different planes into an attack on availability and this is not desirable cryptography algorithms will not provide unevadable security to the transport layer because of flawed endtoend service model transport layer also faces the session hijacking where an adversary hijacks the control on the session between two nodes this is an attack on availability of the network and these attacks occurs because current wireless and internet architecture does not dynamically learn from the previous information of session hijacking 5 application layer application layer is the only layer which interacts with the users and provides full access to the user applications in future networks application layer is considered to be the most crowded and problematic layer user application design and its complexity is only limited by human imaginations this causes a very serious security threat to this layer the major security flaw in application layer lies in the diverse specifications of applications and their security requirements there is no single threat model for dealing with this diversity issue another design flaw in application layer that limits the security of this layer is the lack of coordination with the other layers applications designers are not aware of security issues of other layers and this lack of coordination turns the diversity of application into a hazard application layer security is also compromised due to social and financial conventions it is application layer that defines how network will behave as all other layers are only responsible of their fix actions on the received packets many of the security risks we face now a days are due to bad design choices and compromises in application layer since applications are designed to facilitate the user requirements and this involves money applications developer does not take into consideration the security architecture of the whole communication or internet stack today applications are designed to have more powerful functionality and features to raise finances to do this developer takes security risks such as using active codes such as java scripts and causes a communication and security risks this application layer design approach is known as insecure by design and considered to be the root cause of the major security breaches in communication and internet architecture10 iii b arriers to better security the issues in current wireless and data networks security explained in section ii this section enlists the major challenges that network community need to solve to ensure better security for next generation of communication systems a self organization selforganization so has been defined as learning from the environment and adapting the statistical variations in input stimuli to achieve highly reliable communications whenever and wherever needed the growth in communication devices data hungry application and diverse security requirements has changed the focus of research community from static rule based security to dynamic learning security architectures since user behavior and user application requirements are only bounded by the human imagination the underlying service architecture of current communication system is not good enough to cope with the dynamic security requirements of these applications we need to build a self organization based security in each layerto ensure a better security for next generation of communication systems the desired security requires automated real time measurements and

architecture has different stake holders with aligned or adverse alignment of interests current communication and data network security does not take into consid erations these tussles two major tussles in security architectures are namely useroperator and governments andsecurity and privacy any security architecture design for the future networks have to deal with these tussles design by choice modulerization and cognitive design are the way forward in dealing with tussles design by choice involves offering more control to all stakeholders by designing an intelligent cognitive security architecture in the tussle space 9 1 tussle between user operator and governments this tussle describes the adverse alignment of goals between user operator and government user want an unevadeable security operator wants more control on user traffic for qos traffic analysis and other network performance evaluation where as government want to impose their security policies and these policies are inline with their socioeconomic goals current security architecture lacks in the ability of dealing with this tussle application of cryptography is a very related example to this tussle as user uses multilayer encryption to ensure its security operator does not want this level of encryption because this makes traffic analysis and detection of malicious user very difficult governments want a full control on user and operator operations to use security for user profiling intelligence tracking and other related tasks 2 tussle between security and privacy this tussle is a special case of useroperator and government tussle this tussle has its roots is social behaviors current security architecture of the communication and data network was not designed by keeping in view the social needs of the consumer consumer normally confuses data security with privacy data security is related to confidentiality integrity and integrity of the data whereas privacy is related to right of personal privacy regarding the storing and usage of the user data this tussle has turned into an arms race where users are employing different security techniques to keep their data private and operators are restricting them to ensure security of the network by detecting dos and ddos attacks another example of this tussle is the consumer profiling by different operators and consumer data selling to advertising agencies this has been a major concern in networking community and network designers have to find a balance between security and privacy c lack of systems thinking wireless and data networks were designed is based on a lego approach of learning where we optimize the network operations as separate entities this optimization approach does not posses the ability of dealing11 with the requirements of future communication systems because this independent optimization can cause the unintended consequences on the performance of any other component in the system for example major security problem in current wireless and data networks is due to the lack of coordination among the layers for example to provide powerful functionality application developer does not care for the security issues caused by the design choice made similarly greedy capacity achieving coding technique at the physical layer does not take into account the decoder complexity for future network security should be designed as a system rather than as a service iv n ewwireless paradigm in this section we will present a new cognitive wireless networking design which employees self organization and machine learning to overcome the shortcomings of current wireless and data communication networks mentioned in section i this new design is based on the new improved cognition cycle which not only incorporate the sensing and adapting from surroundings but also involves the knowledge base to ensure systems thinking a improved cognition cycle the cognitive wireless network is motivated by the shortcomings of current networking architecture previous crosslayer network design and cognitive radios design these shortcomings have their basis in in creasing complexity heterogeneity and dynamic networking environments to overcome these shortcomings cognitive wireless networks are expected to be selforganized in future communication systems by employing new network design approaches state of the art machine learning techniques and improved cognition cycle this selforganization can be achieved by introducing a learning and adapting mechanism in configuration optimization and healing process this complexity driven approach set the basis for designing the underlying theory of selforganizing networks intentdriven networks knowledgebased networks software defined networks and many other intelligent networking architectures cognitive wireless networks operation can be summarized in two steps namely cognition andreconfig urability in sensing process cognitive wireless network sense for wireless channel statistics interference estimation and event detection these sensed attributes are then used for building an artificial intelligence in the network whereas reconfigurability stands for adaption of the intelligent decision analyze the radio channel and spectrum usage from surroundings intelligently reconfigure the network operation parameters to select the optimal frequency band for transmission signal processing and machine learning techniques are used to provide cognition and software defined radio is used for providing reconfigurablity figure 1 depicts the new improved cognitive wireless network cycle it also represents the core tasks of the major components and the information flow between these components 1 radio sensing sensing it provides the details about wireless channel sensing network traffic statis tics interference detectionestimation and observing an event the raw information gathered in sensing process describes the characteristics of primary user spectrum radio sensing is also responsible for sensing the activity of primary users when the licensed spectrum is reclaimed this activity sensing helps cognitive wireless networks in avoiding the interference and improve the overall endtoend reliability of the network 2 knowledge base analysis storage in this step the radio network telemetry for the primary user is performed which involves event correlation anomaly detection performance monitoring metric calculation trend analysis network semantics and many other related measurements knowledge base also records all the decision made in previous cognition and reconfigurability cycles along with a set of available actions based on operator policy to improve the endtoend network performance knowledge base combined with intelligent decision making act as a brain of the network which processes the12 fig 1 cognitive wireless network cycle this figure highlights the major components involved in the cognitive wireless networking sensed input and makes an intelligent decision estimation and decision making is another important component of the cognitive wireless network 3 estimation decision making reasoning this step involves the detection of spectrum holes based on the knowledge base information gathered by sensing and processing the spectrum information of the primary users once the spectrum hole is detected a dynamic spectrum manager and handoff procedure enables the secondary user to pick the best frequency this also involves machine learning for channel prediction throughput transmitter capacity or any other customized intelligent decision making with the evolution of deep learning and other efficient unsupervised learning techniques estimation and decision making process in the cognitive wireless network has improved and in turn improved the overall reliability of the cognitive wireless network 4 wireless access link control adapting estimation and decision making section provides the information of channel prediction based on spectrum holes transmitter capacity etc wireless access and link control section of the network implements the reconfiguration based on the provided information a tighter power control is provided by wireless access and link control section in order to keep the interference caused by secondary users to the primary users and the interference among secondary users similarly the competition for spectrum resource is also handled by wireless access and link control section by employing different game theoretic approaches another very important element of the cognitive wireless network is spectrum mobility which ensures the desired qos of primary users mean while providing a resilient service to the secondary users in cognitive wireless network spectrum mobility is defined as the process by which a cognitive wireless13 network user alters its frequency of operation for using the spectrum dynamically allowing radio terminals to operate in the best available frequency band and in case of primary users reappearance ensures a smooth communication to the secondary user with low latency during handoff process spectrum mobility and handoff process proved to be very useful in the multihop cognitive wireless network where we need to relay and route information between dynamically changing channels the cognitive wireless network is a key enabler for nextgeneration communication technologies and due to its wide range of applicability it is a hot topic for research in academia and industry it has many potential applications in wireless sensor networks bluetooth emergency wireless networks vehicular networks smart grids machine to machine communication adhoc wireless networks and most importantly in 5g communications v c onclusion in this report i have discussed the design challenges in wireless and data networks i have discussed issues in the security of current wireless and data networking

focus has led to an internet design that is very costly which has precluded the global deployment of the internet we see this in wired technologies such as the modern fiberbased broadband highspeed network which come close to providing ideal network performance have largely been restricted to urban centers and advanced countries with economical reasons primarily the high cost of laying fiber precluding their universal deployment similarly cellular technologydespite its great successhas not been able to ensure gaia since it is mainly an urban phenomena that cannot be used to cost effectively serve rural and remote areas 23 since internet is overengineered for many practical applications and needs ie not all applications and users of the internet require highfidelity internet services we argue that a viable gaiaenabling approach is the use of approximate networking where contextappropriate tradeoffs are adopted to deal with different challenges and impairments characterizing a certain region we can loosely define approximate networks as networks that are close to ideal in terms of quality nature and quantity we proposed the concept of approximate networking previously in 4 where the presentation of the concept focused on the use of simple approximate goodenough services to tame the complexity of the networking infrastructure in a future world afflicted with hard limits due to the exhaustion of natural resources such as fossil fuels in this paper we argue that apart from its clear use in reducing network complexity with the complementary benefits of more sustainable cheaper services approximate networking can also be used to satisfy the widelydiffering and diverse user requirements by taking contextappropriate tradeoffs and thereby help in realizing the vision of global access to the internet for all gaia our main idea is for universal internet provisioning of mobile and internet services that it is time to move away from pursuing overengineered perfect products and focus instead on developing appropriate good enough solutions our approximate networking idea can be thought of as the network analog of the emerging computer architectural trend called approximate computing 56 which we discuss next 11 what is approximate computing broadly speaking approximate computing leverages the capability of many computing systems and applications to tolerate some loss of quality and optimality by trading off precision for efficiency where efficiency can be in the terms of increased performance or reduced costs in terms of energy consumed or system costarea approximate computing systems are able to optimize the efficiency of systems by relaxing the commonly applied notion of exact numerical or boolean equivalence between the specification and implementation at multiple layers of the hardware and software stacks see figure 1 for a depiction the use of approximate computing is motivated by the following factors 1 modern big data applications are based on noisy realworld data 2 many computing applications eg recommendation and web search do not have a single golden answer 3 the perceptual limitations of users mean that some approximations may not even be noticed and 4 many applications existeg images video and soundwhere minor errors and approximations can be tolerated by different users some recent case studies for applying approximate computing to video processing 7 signal processing 8 and communication systems 9 have shown early feasibility the research in the field of approximate computing has been led by seminal contributions from the industry players such as intel 10 ibm 1112 and microsoft 13 as well as several research groups from academia 561416future internet 2017 9 94 3 of 23 figure 1 whats new about approximate computing adapted from 617 12 what is approximate networking with approximate networking we intend to seamlessly integrate the concepts from approximate computing along with traditional mechanisms for approximations in networking in terms of approximations adopted by networking protocols and algorithms the concept of approximate networking is necessary since experience has shown us that universal commissioning of ideal networks which have extremely high capacity bandwidth and reliability in addition to extremely low or negligible delays errors and congestion is nonpractical it is important to emphasize that approximate networking is not a single standalone technique nor is it the first time that approximation has been proposed in networking indeed a number of existing networking techniques already utilize approximation and are best effort our idea of approximate networking generalizes these classical ideas and importantly supplements these ideas with recent developments in the field of crosslayered approximate computing particularly at the hardware level to facilitate the design of future energyefficient and optimized network infrastructure as well as algorithms and protocols we aim to enable end to end approximation principlesframeworks engaging hardwaresoftware approximation as well as network layer approximations for systematic approximate networking as this point in time there has only been rudimentary work done in efficiently combining lowlevel approximate computing modules to construct larger highlevel modules and architectural components approximate computing has been deployed for a large number of applications including image processing signal processing machine learning scientific computing financial analysis database search and distributed computing however its extension to the field of networking is practically nonexistent at this point in time with only some recent preliminary works as exceptions 1819 we anticipate that these hardwarefocused approximate computing advances will percolate into the field of networking and in the future there will be an increased interest in synergistic approximation management at different layers of the hardware and software stacks in networking 13 why adopt approximate networking 131 affordable universal internet gaia the right of affordable access to broadband internet is enshrined in the 2015 sustainable development goals of the united nations the international telecommunication union itu broadband goal 2020 initiative aims at an optimistic target of universal broadband internet speeds of 20 mbps for 20 a month accessible to everyone in the world by 2020 source alliance for affordable internet a4ai report 2014 such an approach which aims at providing an ideal networking experience universally has historically always failed due to various socioeconomical and technical issues an important reason is that most modern technologies such as 3g 4g longterm evolution lte and the planned 5g are urban focused as rural systems being sparsely populated by definition do not thus hold much business potential for mobile carriers 23 the internet is alsofuture internet 2017 9 94 4 of 23 large unaffordable when we consider that on average the mobile broadband price and the fixedline broadband prices are 12 and 40 of the average persons monthly income where women and rural populations are hit the hardest 20 approximate networking is a particularly appealing option to reach out to the offline human population by providing an affordable contextually good enough service 132 diversity of user application profiles the internets digital divide is not a binary divide there is a spectrum of connectivity options and digital capabilities accessible to people around the world see figure 2 in some places ultra highspeed broadband connections are available while there are hosts of places where there is no connectivity at all however most places lie somewhere in between user and application profiles and requirement vary greatly at one extreme we have applications that require extremely high throughput eg video on demand and low latency eg tactile internet on the other extreme we have applications that have minimal throughput and latency requirements eg smart meters which report back lowvolume data relatively infrequently users can also have vastly different service requirements and financial strength in the face of such great diversity the approximate networking framework can avoid the difficulties of singlesizefitsall networking solutions furthermore these diversities can be exploited and applications and users provided services and resources commensurate to their requirements figure 2 ensuring global access to the internet for all gaia requires provisioning good enough quality of service qos that accommodates the diversity of applications requirements device capabilities user profile and requirements 133 the pareto principle 8020 law the power of good enough to help manage the approximate networking tradeoffs it is instructive to remember the pareto principle alternatively called the 8020 rule 21 which states roughly that 20 of the factors result in 80 of the overall effect this principle has big implications for approximate networking since this allows us to provide adequate fidelity to ideal networking by only focusing on the most important 20 of the effects the key challenge in approximate networking then becomes the task of separating the allimportant essential nontrivial factors from the trivial factors which may be omitted or approximated in this regard we can leverage previous humancomputerinteraction hci research that has shown that human quality of service qos perception can be flawed eg relatively fast service may be judged to be unacceptable if the service is not predictable visually appealing andfuture internet 2017 9 94 5 of 23 reliable 22 in choosing the precise approximate networking tradeoff to adopt such that the users perceive the least inconvenience 134 need of energy efficiency it has been reported that information and communication technology ict is one of the biggest consumer of the worlds electrical energy using up to 5 of the overall energy 2012 statistics 23 the urgency of delivering on the front of energy efficiency is reinforced by the impending decline of nonrenewable energy resources along with the concomitant increase in ict demand the approximate networking trend can augment the hardwarefocused approximate computing trend in managing the brewing energy crisis through the ingenuous use of approximation in particular approximate networking can help generalize the performance and efficiency improvements offered by approximate computing which have largely been limited to local speedups on a single device to broader network settings optimizing communicationnetworking cost is important since these costs can be significant eg on mobile phones the wifi and cellular radios require on average an order of magnitude more power than the cpu or memory 18 14 contributions of this paper the main contribution of this paper is to investigate the extension of the concept of approximate computing to the field of networking we propose approximate networking as an overarching crosslayered framework that encompasses classical approximation techniques as well as recentlydeveloped techniques in the field of approximate computing to implement contextappropriate networking tradeoffs that are necessary for the aims of global access to the internet for all gaia in order to facilitate these tradeoffs apart from the classical approximation techniques adopted in networking in the areas of softwarehardware algorithms protocols and architecture approximate networking will also leverage the advances in the fastemerging field of approximate computing as an extra degreeoffreedom for finergrained tradeoff optimization we also propose approximate networking as an overarching framework for systematically thinking about networking tradeoffs that must be adopted for ensuring gaia furthermore we also present an application of approximate networking in 5g with a case for low income and rural regions this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes approximate networking technologies in section 3 we present contextappropriate approximate tradeoffs for networking we describe a case study for approximate 5g networks in rural and low income areas in section 4",

internet in a box 27 that approximate the internet experience without actually connecting to the internet the novel aspect of approximate networking is that it can leverage advances in hardwarebased approximate computing developments in particular researchers can utilize crosslayer approximation across the computing stack refer to figure 1 where the stack contains in addition to the networking programming languages compilers operating systemsdatabases and hardware architectures for instance approximate programming languages such as enerj enerc etc can be used to specify the critical and the noncritical aspects of computation eg enerj is a general purpose programming language built as an extension to java that exposes hardware faults in a safe principled manner results have shown large amounts of energy savings with slight sacrifices to qos the same general idea applies to networking devices such as switches and routers where not all operations are equivalentsome aspects have to be precise while others can be approximate approximate computing can be used to differentially specify the critical parts of the program and the less critical parts depending upon their inherent resilience properties see resilience characterization in 14 in this manner approximate networking can have greater support from the hardware in implementing contextappropriate approximations a representative taxonomy of approximate networking concepts is shown in figure 3 a summary of some sample works related to the various facets of approximate networking taxonomy highlighted in the taxonomy presented in is also presented in table 1 for illustrative purposes 22 approximate networking hardware with physical limits beginning to stall the exponential growth of electronics due to moores law and the dennards scaling it seems to be the case that future hardware devices and by extension future network switches and routers will use approximate computing in one way or another in terms of hardware support networking in most end user devices such as smartphones tablets laptops and embedded devices such as smart tv is implemented using applicationspecific integrated circuits asics these endnodes are general purpose computing devices that have networkinterfacecards nics built in for connecting to networks in contrast we also have specialized networking devices such as routers switches hubs and firewalls that function as the building blocks of networks such devices have in addition to nics also switching fabrics and use various techniques such as memorybased

parallelism using ternary content addressable memory tcam multiplexers and demultiplexers and counters which are all amenable to approximate computing as explained in 28 two principal components of network hardware are 1 the implementation of packet processing logic through combinational logic and 2 memory based components in implementing combinational logic there are two approximating options firstly the elementary building blocks of approximate adder and multiplier which are typically implemented in arithmetic logic units and are used in counters already have an approximate computing implementation that return impressive gains 28 such adders and counters can be used in implementing the set of counters maintained by the simple network management protocol snmp that is implemented by all routers today secondly the complex logic in a larger circuit can be replaced with an approximate optimized pseudoequivalent circuit when implementing memory in networking devices approximation can be implemented at the level of sram dram and tcams approximate caches have been built that avoid cache misses by using approximation based on temporal and spatial correlation present in data stored in memory this can be used to avoid expensive powerhungry access of dram furthermore the power consumed in accessing dram can be reduced through refresh rate control using which the errorpower tradeoff

voltage overscaling using which the voltage is deliberately reduced for improving power efficiency of circuits such a technique can be used in approximate networking to build hybrid memories with power efficient unreliable memory arrays that can drastically improve power efficiency through aggressive voltage overscaling approximate networking can also use functional approximation at various levels particularly at the architectural circuitlevel and at the transistor level this can include the use of neural networks for learning a simplified approximation of code 28 we note here that approximate computing technology is not limited to generalpurpose central processing unit cpu architecture only companies are already resorting to approximate computing to obtain energy and cost optimized applicationspecific integrated circuits asics eg google has made a custom asic named the tensor processing unit to run machine learningbased tasks at scale in their data centers while requiring fewer transistor per operation similarly ibm exploited the error resilience of deep neural networks to loss of numerical precision for better area and power efficiency systems 12 we believe it is only a matter of time before these ideas would find way to network asics and that more research is needed on how these technologies will interplay with the networklayer stack 23 approximate networking software algorithms implementing approximate networking can be useful in many scenarios where aspects of a system such as ease of use functionality and robustness may be more important than performance alone the idea of approximation is an oftused tool in networking algorithms 45 approximate networking algorithms 46 also called heuristics are often required in networking to tackle discrete optimization problems many of which are nphard and thus there are no efficient algorithms to find optimal solutions such algorithms have been widely used in scheduling routing and qos problems in networking in the book network algorithmics 45 varghese has distilled 15 important highperformance principles that have wide applicability in networks many of which are based on efficient approximations and tradeoffs in particular principle 3 talks of trading certainty for time p3a and trading accuracy for time p3b with p3a randomized strategies are used when deterministic algorithms may be too slow eg the use of randomization in deciding when to transmit after a collision in millions of ethernets worldwide with p3b the idea is to relax accuracy requirements for speed eg by using lossy compression approximation thresholds approximate sorting and approximate set membership query algorithms such as the bloom filter and cuckoo filter in particular bloom filters which is a highspeed approximate set membership query algorithm whose tests that can return false positives but never false negatives have been extensively applied in networking in a wide variety of settings 47 bloom filters are important since a large number of applications require fast matching of arbitrary identifiers to values since it is common to have millions or even billions of entries we require efficient and scalable methods for storing updating and querying tables although bloom filters can return a few false positives their real utility is in alleviating the scaling problems that a number of diverse network applications face broder and mitzenmacher have articulated the bloom filter principle 47 whenever a list or set is used and space is at a premium consider using a bloom filter if the effect of false positives can be mitigated bloom filters have been used for diverse ends in networking and distributed systems such as caching peertopeer systems routing and forward and monitoring and measurement 47 code perforation is another softwarebased approximate computing technique that can be used to automatically identify errorresilient portions within a code that can be skipped while keeping the error within a predefined range 6future internet 2017 9 94 10 of 23 24 approximate networking protocol stack various approximations have already been adopted by transportlayer protocols to handle multimedia traffic over the besteffort internet datagram congestion control protocol dccp can provide congestion control services without the reliability overhead of tcp udp is approximate in the sense that it trades off reliability for efficiency and rapidness udplite 40 is a connectionless protocol that approximates the performance of udp but it uses partial checksums thus while udp always discards packets that fail checksums udplite relaxes the integrity checks to deliver timely but potentially partially erroneous packets to multimedia applications udplite is designed for accelerating errortolerant realtime multimedia streaming applications that can tolerate slight errors while udplite can provide a significant throughput improvement by relaying partially corrupted packets to the application layer 18 care must be adopted to ensure that 1 there does not exist a conflict between the linklayer checksum eg 80211 fcs and the udplite checksum which can result in the link layer refusing to carry damaged data and 2 the additional throughput is not in carrying useless data for the applicationthis may require the use of erasureerror protection at the application layer approximate packet processing circuits that return imprecise answers will have the benefit that they will be much smaller than those today they would consume less power and many more of them could fit on a single chip greatly increasing the number of packets it could process at once however a critical question is how these imprecise packet processing affect the performance of higherlayer networking stack since the approximate networking technology is inchoate we cannot answer with certainty how the lowlevel hardwarebased approximate computing developments will affect the performance of the network upperlayer stack however we can definitely foresee the need to approximation semantics at the upper layers of the networking stack so that hardwarelevel approximate computing features can be efficiently utilized otherwise the potential benefits of approximation will be frittered away as the network may attempt a reliable and precise transfer of approximate data some approximate networking semantics naturally exists as part of the tcpip stack eg through the best effort service provided by the udp and ip protocols there have been many disparate efforts at the transport layer which can be categorized as approximate networking efforts standard reliable transport protocols like tcp work well for file transfer applications but are too unwieldy for multimedia applications that prioritize speed of transfer and have some error tolerance to ensure that we have appropriate communication support for approximate data some essential mechanisms that should be supported include 19 1 optional multilayer integrity check support currently the different network layers perform redundant checksums eg tcp over wifi uses three separate checksums namely the tcp layer the ip layer and the link layer in an approximate networking context it is useful to permit some errors in approximate payloads 2 partial integrity checking for critical data eg addresses and ports must be precise it is typical in networking to discard erroneous packets that have been received with checksum errors both tcp and udp discard erroneous packets tcp also asks for a retransmission to ensure reliability however in the spirit of approximation partial errors in noncritical data can be tolerated udplite 40 is an example transport protocol that performs partial integrity checking through the use of a configurable checksum which specifies how many bits are protected by checksum 3 applicationprovided approximation specification and switching between these specifications for a given socket at the level of different layers as an example work selective approximate protocol sap 18 allows applications to coordinate with multiple networks layers to accept potentially damaged data the authors of sap which is built over udplite have reported a 30 speedup for an errortolerant file transfer application over wififuture internet 2017 9 94 11 of 23 3 contextappropriate approximate networking tradeoffs 31 tradeoffs in networking in a complex system such as the internet and the networking tcpip ecosystem in which multiple subsystems work in silos isolated from each other there is a danger that improvementsimplification of one subsystem may increase the complexity of some of the other subsystems and deteriorate their performance we propose that approximate networking ecosystem as a holistic systemsoriented framework that can offer contextappropriate management of the various tradeoffs involved in networking in terms of performance cost and complexity some of these tradeoffs are discussed below fidelity versus affordabilityconvenience a lot of research has shown that customers are willing to sacrifice considerable fidelity for a more convenient and accessible service 48 the notion of fidelity matches with the qos quality of experience qoe concept convenience subsumes concepts such as the cost accessibilityavailability and simplicity of the service the fact that users are willing to tradeoff fidelity for convenience and affordability is an extremely important insight for our topic latency versus throughput it is well known in literature that throughputoptimal solutions can compromise performance in terms of delay 49 the sneakernet concept long known in networking folklore never underestimate the bandwidth of a station wagon full of tapes hurtling down the highway andrew tanenbaum 1981 is the embodiment of the latencythroughput tradeoff in a similar vein dtn routing protocols also tradeoff latency for throughput and connectivity ie dtn bundles can achieve the same throughput as ip protocols but with longer latency throughput versus coveragereliability in wireless networks there is a tradeoff between the throughput and the coverage and the reliability of a transmission ie for higherrate transmissions the coverage area is typically smaller and the bit error rate higher the idea of approximate networking can be used to provide contextappropriate qos to 5g users 3 by provisioning higher rates to users and applications where feasible and desired while still allowing everyone access to basic connectivity allowing users who are currently offline to come online coverage versus consumed power in wireless networks the coverage of a transmission is directly proportional to the transmission power since nodes do not need to communicate at all times researchers have proposed putting to sleep parts of the infrastructure such as the base transceiver station bts of cellular systems to save on energy costs other tradeoffs many innovative solutions are able to improve performance by inventing a new tradeoff for example vulimiri et al discovered that an interesting way to reduce latency is to tradeoff some additional capacity or redundancy ie the authors showed that latency can be reduced by by initiating redundant operations across diverse resources and using the first complete response 50 future approximate networking solutions can derive much utility by focusing on discovering new ways of developing contextappropriate new tradeoffs 32 leveraging approximation when dealing with contextappropriate tradeoffs that come with approximate networking an important concept is that of pareto optimality which refers to a state of resource allocation in which it is not possible to make any one individual better off without making at least one individual worse off the set of values that are each pareto optimal together constitute the pareto frontier the main benefit of using approximate networking is that it can leverage the degreeoffreedom of leveraging errors to shift the pareto frontier see the tradeoff being depicted in figure 4 such that performance and cost may be improved simultaneously at the cost of some inaccuracy which is designed to be under the threshold necessary for acceptable qosfuture internet 2017 9 94 12 of 23 figure 4 leveraging the extra degree of freedom of exploiting errors can improve performance while reducing cost 33 how can we visualize the tradeoffs an interesting approach to understanding tradeoffs is to use visualization techniques in approximate networking the task for optimizing for one explicit parameter is easier than optimizing for multiple optimization variables such as throughput delay and energy the main problem arises when the various objectives are conflicting and have to compete for dominance",

increase the number of bits delivered per unit energy for given user density and total power in the service area similarly the hetnet arrangement of overlaying a macrocell with micropicocells at the edge can also help save energy 61 figure 9 illustrates a better se vs ee tradeoff for lte pico cells as compared to lte micro cells and global system for mobile communication gsmfuture internet 2017 9

design space with many potential tradeoffs 60 such as deployment efficiency vsenergy efficiency spectrum efficiency vsenergy efficiency bandwidth vs power and latency vs power a comparison of parameters for the various 5g use cases are shown in figure 10 mainstream 5g research has taken up the challenge of providing highquality 5g service with gusto but such an approach will result in an overengineered system that will be too expensive to install and maintain for lowincome andor rural areas by suitably scaling the level of service 5g can encompass a broader coverage base as an example the requirement for supporting highdefinition hd video and tactile internet may be dropped in lowincome scenarios but may be supported for urban and highincome rural environments since the rural users would likely prefer goodenough service to no service researchers can explore using the traditional 5g tradeoffs in conjunction with the newly developed flexibility of approximate computing and approximate networking to produce cost effective solutions for lowincome andor rural areas figure 8 spectral energy vs energy efficiency tradeoffs for different circuit powers adapted from 63future

adapted from resources made available by the european telecommunications standards institute etsi httpwwwetsiorg we can also use techniques that bring us more flexibility and convenience in reducing the cost of networking with techniques such as using 1 renewable energy sources such as solar power 2 base station sleep modes 3 the building blocks proposed in approximate computing literature such as the digital baseband processors proposed in 16 for 5g infrastructure such as base stations 4 virtualization of network components using techniques such as network functions virtualization nfv 5 exploitation of commodity hardware 6 using community networking and resource pooling principles 7 achieving flexibility using a separation of control and data planes and 8 achieving flexibility by integrating software defined networks sdn and nfv 64 using such technologies coupled with a wellthought out approximate networking design it is feasible to provide contextuallyappropriate goodenough services in a sustainable fashion at a low cost in the order of 1 usd for lowincome regions and 10 usd for rural regions chiaraviglio et al 65 have proposed a mix of lowcost solutions and techniques to bring 5g to rural and lowincome regions for instance remote radio heads rrhs can be mounted on unmanned aerial vehicle and balloons low cost solar powered large cells with coverage radius in the order of 50 km and delay tolerant networks for 5g to provide cellular access in rural areas this mixture was proposed considering the application context of rural areas which comprised basic delay tolerant connectivity that could support applications such as ehealth elearning and emergency services an economic analysis of these techniques in 56 showed a monthly subscription fee of 11 euros for rural areas of italy and cook islands and a monthly subscription fee of 1 euro for lowincomefuture internet 2017 9 94 17 of 23 but slightly more populated rural areas of zimbabwe this shows the viability of a lowcost but still functional approximate 5g networking service another way we can adopt approximate networking in 5g in rural and lowincome regions is to allow more simultaneous transmissions by multiple users in each orthogonal resource block be it a time slot a frequency channel or a spreading code using nonorthogonal multiple access noma noma is now being considered as a front runner 5g technology since it is compatible with conventional orthogonal multiple access techniques such as tdma and ofdma noma can allow for a contextappropriate tradeoff by catering to varied channel conditions at the users and by allocating more power to the user with poorer channel conditions or adjusting the power to facilitate the respective contextappropriate qos requirements using the cognitive radio noma crnoma variant it can be ensured that some or all of the users qos requirements are satisfied noma also allows chunking of users into multiple groups which can then be served in the same orthogonal block using multicarrier noma and different groups are allocated different orthogonal resource blocks this can facilitate management of contextappropriate tradeoffs for a large numbers of users that can be logically organized in different user classesgroups community networking and resource pooling is another enabling general architectural tool for rural area 5g networking 66 these efforts are being given a boost by open source technologies and plummeting prices of commodity hardware eg the introduction of low cost software defined radios and open source softwares such as openbts have made community cellular very feasible for rural areas using such technologies community cellular networks can be built in rural area networks in a doityourself diy bottomup fashion in contrast to a traditional gsm macrocell for rural areas which can cost around 500000 usd heimerl et al 67 have shown a complete deployment of functional 2g community base station in rural papua indonesia at a much cheaper price of around 10000 usd the study showed that 187 subscribers were served with a cheap 10000 usd base station thereby providing 830 dollars as monthly revenue with 368 dollars as profit the gsm band for the project was not purchased due to high spectrum cost and the cell was operating in conjunction with the government officials this nonavailability of legal spectrum can be tackled by exploiting the gsm whitespaces discussed in 68 it can be anticipated that recent approximate computing hardware advances will soon permeate networking solutions particularly with 5g appliances becoming virtualized and running as software appliances on cloud data centers with the increased adoption of cloud computing and nfv the neural processing unit npu is a prominent example of new approximate computing hardware which can provide significant benefits such as an average speedup and energy savings of 23 and 3respectively with relatively few errors npus have been shown to provide these gains on almost all type of program applications including signal processing image processing machine learning graphics and gaming 31 has tested the gains of npus on these applications including fast fourier transform which is the one of the most important task of multicarrier communication such as ofdm huawei also recently announced kirin 970 a smart phone processor featuring a dedicated npu for superior performance and efficiency 69 with the current developments in approximate computing and the diverse use cases of npus the time is right to apply these concepts to the development of network hardware such as routers switches network interface cards nics as well as to rf components digital and analog processors and the various hardware blocks of rans further studies considering the affects of area and power efficient approximate hardware on cost and efficiency of cellular networks will provide a more detailed overview of the true potential of approximate networking the time is now ripe to design cost efficient accelerated approximate memory and processors considering the demands of cellular systems for example the use of approximate digital blocks to design content addressable memory widely used for packet classification and forwarding in routers and the impact of new errors on system level performance will provide deep insights on the feasibility of approximate networking similarly self organizing networks son proposed for future cellular networks 70 use machine learning algorithms for various selffuture internet 2017 9 94 18 of 23 organization phases cost area and power efficient hardware at the cost of 100 percent accuracy are proposed for machine learning and deep learning applications 12 the use cases for sons using approximate hardware can reduce the cost of futuristic cellular systems however a detailed and careful analysis of the resultant performance degradation and cost benefit is necessary to understand the benefits and penalties of approximate networking furthermore the codesign of approximate hardware and software stack can help to extract maximum benefits of approximate networking 5 discussion issues 51 zero rating and net neutrality in recent times the idea that internet access is a human right is gaining increasing traction as shown by a recent global internet survey conducted by the internet society 71 there have been recent efforts that have strived to make basic internet access accessible to everyone one approach that has been adopted is the concept of zerorating through which various mobile companies are offering cheaper or free access to selected websites and applications while the idea at its surface appears noble and harmless it has become controversial due to its relationship with net neutralitythe idea that all content on the internet is equal and should be treated such one way of provisioning an approximate internet experience is to curate a walled garden in such an approach a company or service provider provides access to a limited set of approved sites and services through its platform typically at a reduced rate or even free facebook has adopted the walled garden approach for its free basics program this project has however become controversial with india recently ruling that program and others like it infringe the principles of net neutrality critics of the program have criticized that facebook is violating the tenets of net neutrality project and that such a project leads to an unfair market since in this project a forprofit company facebook adopts a position where it can decide which service qualifies as an essential service whats better approximate or zilch it has been discussed that how users are often willing to tradeoff fidelity for convenience this would seem to imply that users will be happy with accessible approximate networking solutions when conveniently available people are divided over the utility of zero rating with one group asserting that zero rating programs can help as a helpful adhoc arrangement while others argue that these programs create a tiered internet ecosystem that is still not able to bridge the digital divide 72 the net neutrality and zero rating debate is not only a rational debate but also an emotional and moral one in some cases people may prefer no networking service to an approximate networking service research on the experience of users has however shown that while it is true that some access is better than none users are not always thrilled at being limited to a vastly limited subset of the internet 73 to understand why users may turn something for nothing it is instructive to refer to the classical gametheoretic ultimatum game in this game the first player receives a sum of money and proposes a sharing offer to the second player the second player can either choose to accept or reject this offer if the second player accepts the money is split as proposed otherwise neither player gets anything under rational economic theory assumptions the second player should accept any offer since something is better than nothing in utility however a number of experiments have shown that typically the responder will not accept unfair divisions and will deprive the proposer by rejecting the offer in the process losing his money as well this game demonstrates the nuance of the question whats better approximate or none notwithstanding the problems that current zerorated approaches are facing we believe that the goal of democraticizing internet service is worthwhile researchers agree that more research is needed to fully access the impact of specific zero rating initiatives as well as the potential impact of zero rating more generally on internet adoption in the developing world and in rural and lowincome regions 72 in particular more research is required to study user preferences regarding limited accessfuture internet 2017 9 94 19 of 23 to the complete internet vs unlimited access to an incomplete internet while facebooks free basics is probably not the right solution it may be the case that betterdesigned good enough solutions offered at a convenient and affordable price will disrupt the currently established markets 52 hci issues user perceptions of the approximation previous humancomputerinteraction hci research has shown that humans subjective knowledge can be flawed relatively fast service may be judged to be unacceptable unless it is also predictable visually appealing and reliable 74 more research is needed on which kinds of weaknesses are most perceived by users this knowledge can then be used to determine the precise approximate networking tradeoff to adopt so that the users perceive least inconvenience if it turns out that the pareto principle or the 8020 rule is applicable then we can optimize for the approximation that is responsible for 80 of user perceived qos in view of the users experience high network latency has an obvious detrimental effect on latencybound applications such as gaming voice and web applications while bandwidth is admittedly important for qos especially for bulk transfer and video applications it turns out that the roundtriptime rtt can dominate performance more than bandwidth for short bursty http connections 75 especially over longdistance widearea networks wans 76 it has been shown in humancomputer interaction hci literature that increments of only 100 ms can decrease sales by 1 and human can sense and do react to small differences in the delays of operations 50 6 conclusions the utopian goal of providing ideal networking service universally is an elusive target due to the moving target nature of ideal networking and the lack of affordability of advanced technologies in challenging markets a lot of experience has highlighted the fidelityconvenience tradeoff which is seen when users are willing to tradeoff considerable fidelity for convenience in terms of accessibility and affordability in this paper we have described approximate networking as a philosophy that understands that there will no onesizefitsall ideal networking solution that will be universally applicableapproximation networking proposes to adopt appropriate contextspecific tradeoffs to provide goodenough service in addition we have also provided an overview of approximate networking technologies and have highlighted how a number of existing internet technologies can be seen as instances of the larger approximation networking vision approximate networking as envisioned in this paper is a powerful abstraction that has significant promise for global access to the internet for all gaia realizing approximate networking will require multidisciplinary research in diverse domains such as algorithms protocols operating systems and hardware architectures we believe that approximate networking can provide a novel fundamental tuning knob that can facilitate contextappropriate tradeoffs by adopting the extra degreeoffreedom of approximate computing at the hardware level that can help realize the egalitarian vision of gaia author contributions all authors

the emergence of 5g internet of things iot and other related technologies network traffic volume is expected to grow up to 33 zettabyte zb per year or 35 gigabyte gb per capita per month by 2021 5 with this exponential growth in network traffic volume and inception of many datahungry communication applications network traffic classification becomes a very challenging problem for users and service providers classical network traffic classification techniques are based on port and payload inspection but these schemes have their shortcomings in terms of dealing with a large amount of data and different types of network traffic recent advances in machine learning ml such as deep learning dl techniques have produced exceptional results in many application domains including computer vision natural language processing speech recognition and system control dl is a branch of mltechniques where a hierarchical structure of neural network layers is used to autonomously learn the features and then those learned features are used for classification or prediction the success of mldl in multiple application domains has motivated the networking community to explore the potential benefits of these techniques for building an autonomous control for improving the per formance of networking applications such as network traffic classification anomaly and intrusion detection in the last few years many mldl based networking solutions have been proposed highlighting the applications and challenges of using ml techniques in the networking domain 7 9 14 30 31 recently mldl techniques were found to be vulnerable to carefully crafted perturbations in the test examples theseexamples are known as adversarial ml examples adversarial examples force the mldl algorithm to malfunction and produce incorrect results dl schemes especially deep neural networks dnn are function approximators that have an associated generalization error which makes them vulnerable to adversarial ml attacks adversarial ml attacks can be divided into two broader categories based on the adversarys knowledge namely whitebox adversarial attacks ie per fect knowledge and blackbox adversarial attacks ie real world settings in this paper we take network traffic classification as a functional proxy for mldl based autonomous networking applications and propose a blackbox adversarial ml attack on network traffic classification although the focus of our paper is on network traffic classification our findings are broadly applicable to similar settings that involve other applications of mldl to realize autonomous networks the purpose of our proposed attack is to compromise the integrity of network traf fic classification to shed light on the risks involved in utilizing mldl techniques in support of networking applications our results indicate that the current state of the art mldl based network traffic classification algorithms do not pro vide substantial deterrence against adversarial ml attacks our experiments utilize the highly cited tornontor dataset provided by habibi et al 18 to perform the proposed black box adversarial ml attack on tornontor traffic classifier to demonstrate that using current mldl techniques to realize autonomous networks can be a potential security risk contributions the contributions of this work are twofold propose and validate a blackbox adversarial ml attack on network traffic classification tornontor classifica tion to the best of our knowledge this is the first blackbox adversarial ml attack on network

classification tor 8 is a low latency anonymity preserving system that is based on overlay network that anonymizes the traffic of tcp based applications it is also known as onion routing tech nique for traffic anonymization in tor messages are encrypted and transmitted through distributed onion routers where each router uses a symmetric key to decrypt the messages and learn the routing details ie next onion router the same process goes on in each router and this process obscures the actual transmitter from the users perspective tor provides security and privacy whereas from service providers perspective detection and classification of the tor traffic becomes a very difficult challenge 26 tor traffic classification is a key component of networking architecture it is expected and experimentally validated that deep ml techniques outperform classical tor traffic classi fication algorithms alsabah et al 2 used a decision tree bayesian networks and naive bayes techniques for classifying tor network traffic into two classes namely interactive traffic eg browsing and bulk traffic eg torrent downloading the purpose of their classification was to improve the quality of service qos of the tor network in their twoway classi fication experiments they managed to achieve 95 accuracy and 75 improvement in tor responsiveness ling et al 19 proposed torward a malware detection and classification technique for tor traffic which improves the tor performance he et al 13 described a hidden markov model based on tor traffic classification schemes their presented model classifies the tor traffic into four categories namely p2p ftp im and web with 92 accuracy unsupervised ml learning schemes such as gravitational clustering have been used for tor traffic classification and the results were compared with classic clustering schemes in 25 hodo et al 15 used artificial neural networks anns and support vector machines svms for binary classification of the tornontor dataset and demonstrated 99 accuracy habibi et al 18 used decision trees knn and random forest techniques to perform binary classification on the tornontor dataset pescape et al 24 proposed a traffic classification technique using multinomial naive bayes and random forest techniques b adversarial ml attacks since adversarial ml attacks have not yet been thoroughly explored in the networking domain we first review their applications and effects in other domains deep ml tech niques especially dnns were demonstrated to produce the best classification results in many application domains but they also learn counterintuitive and uninterpretable properties due to discontinuity in the learning process and generalization error 27 these counterintuitive properties can be exploited to form adversarial attacks that deteriorate the performance of dnn based classifiers goodfellow et al 11 proposed an adversarial perturbation generation method to fool dnn based classifiers called fastgradient sign method fgsm in fgsm an adversarial perturbation is calculated by computing the gradient of the cost function with respect to the input itself an extension of fgsm is proposed in 17 where fgsm was iteratively applied with a smaller step size to fool the dnn this method is known as the basic iterative method papernot et al 23 proposed a forward derivative based approach for crafting adversarial perturbations known as jacobian saliency map based attack jsma carlini et al 4 proposed three adversarial perturbation crafting methods for evading robust ml classifiers by exploiting three different distance matrices l1l2 andl1 moosavi et al 21 proposed deepfool to evade ml classifiers where adversarial perturbations were generated through the iterative linearization of the classifier transferability of adversarial ml examples such as logistic regression and svm has been studied in 22 where it is highlighted that svm is less prone to adversarial perturbation due to its training specificity and decision boundary learning process more details about adversarial ml attacks are described in 1 3 20 adversarial attacks on network traffic classification have not yet been covered duly in literature we will cover some general networking applications where basic adversarial ml research has been conducted in our previous work we have used fgsm bim and jsma based attacks to highlight the vulnera bility of using ml in cognitive selforganizing networks under whitebox settings ie the adversary knows details about training data training process and model

summary of the notation used in our blackbox attack procedure 1 adversary knowledge the proposed attack in this paper only considers blackbox adversarial ml attack model where the adversary has no knowledge of training data number of layers in the model training hyperparameters type of layers and training data the adversary can only access the output of the deep ml model ie dnn in this case in a query response manner the adversary can send an input to the model and collect the label as a response these queryresponse pairs are later used for crafting an adversarial attack we assume that the adversary can only perform an adversarial attack during the test time other attacks such as poisoning attacks are not within the scope of this study 2 adversarial goals the goal of the adversary is to compromise the integrity and availability of the tor traffic classifier by minimally altering the test examples in adver sarial attacks on computer vision and natural language pro cessing applications the fundamental restriction on adversarial examples is to preserve the visual representation or semantic meaning of the image or text respectively this restriction is replaced with a more difficult one in the context of networking where the adversary has to ensure that the applied adversarial perturbation does not affect the functional behavior of the network traffic b tor classification model in this work we use dnn and svm for tor traffic classification svm is a well known ml technique used for classification and regression whereas dnns are wellknown for being capable of solving complex classification tasks by extracting hierarchical representation from their input dnn consists of multiple layers of neurons smallest computational unit each layers output is the input of the next layer the nonlinear activation function is used to ensure that each neuron also learns nonlinear information the output layer of the dnn uses softmax as activation function to produce the classification probability vector we use the dnn and svm classifiers for binary and multi class classification where binary classification is performed between tor and nontor traffic and multiclass classification is performed between different tor traffic classes we used stochastic gradient descent with a batch size of 100 for training the classifier we used a 7030 ratio of the data figure 1 steps for designing a blackbox adversarial attack on network traffic classification processes through synthetic data generation substitute model generation and adversarial sample crafting for training and validation purposes we achieved 96 and 9354 accuracy for binary class classification using dnn and svm respectively for multiclass classification we achieved 9060 and 8060 accuracy using dnn and svm respec tively classification accuracy of both models can be improved by carefully choosing hyperparameters for dnn training c blackbox attack procedure in this subsection we delineate the procedure used to per form the blackbox adversarial ml attack on tor traffic classi fication models the proposed adversarial attack is performed in two steps namely substitute model training andadversarial sample

architecture s the goal in training sis to mimic the decision boundary of the deployed classifier f this process is divided into two components namely substitute model architecture design synthetic dataset collection and substitute dnn training on synthetic dataset substitute model architecture design and synthetic dataset collection are very challenging tasks since the adversary has no information about fs architecture and training process selection of appropriate architecture for sand training pro cedures are performed heuristically in our experiments we selected dnn as our substitute architecture the adversarial attack proposed in this paper is also applicable to other mldl architectures with some modifications to the training process the adversary can also train multiple mldl models to find the besttrained substitute model sapprox substitute model sis trained using synthetic data samples qprepared by querying ffor labelsy we used a moderate number of queries

training to efficiently scale jade for operation in realworld mobile networks using a realworld 4g ran dataset from a multinational mobile network operator we demonstrate the efficacy of proposed jammer detection methods relative to commonly used anomaly detection methods we also demonstrate the robustness of our proposed methods in accurately detecting jammer activity across multiple frequency bands and diverse types of jammers we present realworld validation results from applying our methods in the operators network for online jammer detection we also present promising results on pinpointing jammer locations when our methods spot jammer activity in the network along with cell site location data i introduction jamming is the intentional interference aimed at disrupting wireless communications services and as such can be seen as a denial of service dos attack 1 2 the use and sale of jamming devices commonly referred to as jammers is therefore illegal in many countries eg 3 4 and any violations may result in imprisonment or fines eg 5 6 nevertheless jammers targeting all wireless communications technologies continue to be widely available and in fact quite affordable see 79 for example the threat posed by jammers to robust wireless communications including on mobile networks is expected to become worse in the future with lowcost and opensource softwaredefined radio sdr platforms becoming easily available to arm malicious actors 1012 in this paper we consider jamming in operational mobile networks and in particular focus on the problem of detecting jammer activity in this context the activation of jammers can severely deteriorate the service quality in a mobile network fig 1 shows the impact on selected celllevel key performance indicators kpis due to the presence of a jammer using data from an operational 4g network we observe that the jammer activation effectively shuts down the network for users forcing uplink ul and downlink dl traffic volumes and throughputs down to nearzero the levels of received signalstrength indicator rssi can also be elevated by over 20db 100x increase with a jammer these results highlight the potential risk posed by jammers to the robustness of mobile networks this applies not just to currently deployed 3g and 4g networks that the society heavily relies on for personal mobile communications emergency response systems and public safety networks but also for future 5g networks that aspire to support diverse use cases including ultrareliable and lowlatency communications services eg connected vehicles remote surgery the jammer detection in current practice however is a highly manual process that is costly and slow resulting in degradation in user quality of experience qoe while the jammer induced interference is detected and resolved when significant service quality deterioration or network outage is noticed which may be prompted by user reporting radio network engineers manually examine large volumes of multidimensional network kpi data to diagnose the problem which may also require field testing moreover when jammer activity is intermittent it can be perceived as a radio network problem and result in misguided network reconfigurationsoptimizations thus in current operational mobile networks according to the operators themselves it may take days or weeks after the jammer activation for it to be detected this suggests that jammer detection is a perfect use case for automation in mobile networks that can not only lead to savings in operating expenditure opex costs for operators but also enhance user qoe jammer detection is also the first step that can enable further troubleshooting to identify and pinpoint the interference source in view of the above we aim at automated jammer detection for operational mobile networks that can automatically and quickly detect jammer deactivations then trigger alarms to kickstart downstream resolution processes while this clearly involves reliable detection of all kinds of malicious jammers we also aim to detect the operation of other unintentional interference sources eg malfunctioning devices dect phones that can cause jammerlike impact on the network achieving this goal however is hard as it requires addressing the following challenges 1any available groundtruth label information on jammer activations to build an

while others exhibit complex discontinuous activation patterns they also differ from each other in their type eg military drone specific jammer dect phone the networks eg 3g 4g and frequency bands they target in our realworld dataset we have encountered jammers that can affect as many as ten different frequency bands moreover newer types of jammers with a priori unknown characteristics can emerge over time 3jammer related activity needs to be disambiguated from network kpi dynamics induced from normal and expected behavior eg due to user mobility network overload but this can be challenging for example with active but distant jammers to this end we present jade which to the best of our knowledge is the first automated jammer detection framework for operational mobile networks by treating jammer activity as abnormal or anomalous from the mobile radio access network ran infrastructure side jade approaches jammer detection as an anomaly detection problem 1315 jade is envisioned for operator side deployment and considers cells at each tower site as measurement vantage points it continually monitors the time series of various kpis at each of these cells to detect anomalous behavior over time at the core of jade are two deep learning based time series anomaly detection methods that we developed they work with multivariate kpi data at each cell in the first method a multivariate long short term memory lstm neural network model tracks the variation of uplink rssi observed at each cell to predict its future value and detects an anomaly jammer activation when the difference between the predicted and the actual value is more than a threshold the second method models multivariate kpi time series using a lstm autoencoder model and the associated reconstruction error over time is compared against a threshold to detect jammer activation to address the several challenges outlined above ie limited labeled data ability to detect new and a priori unknown jammer activity discrimination of jammer activity from normal kpi dynamics jade operates in a semisupervised anomaly detection mode 13 in that it relies only on normal datafor training the above outlined models this jammer agnostic nature of jade also makes it robust for detecting jammers that may exhibit adversarial behaviors jade also embeds a mechanism to adaptively set thresholds to detect anomalies thereby adjust the boundary between normal and abnormal events to efficiently support the detection of jammers at scale in realworld mobile networks across multiple cells and operating frequency bands we employ transfer learning 16 to develop one frequency and cell agnostic model instead of a different model for each cell and frequency band in summary we make the following key contributions we propose jade a novel datadriven jammer activity detection framework for operational mobile networks iii which addresses this problem for the first time it incorporates two alternative customtailored semi supervised deep learning based anomaly detection methods for the jammer detection task along with an adaptive thresholding mechanism jade also leverages transfer learning towards efficient modeling and ease of deployability we extensively evaluate the jade framework using a 4g radio access network ran dataset from a multinational mobile network operator iv our results show that the anomaly detection methods developed for jade outperform a wide range of commonly used anomaly detection methods when applied to the jammer detection task and also confirm the effectiveness of jades adaptive thresholding mechanism we demonstrate the robustness of the jade framework powered by transfer learning in accurately detecting jammer activity across multiple frequency bands and diverse types of jammers we also present realworld validation results by applying our methods in the operators network for online jammer detection as a downstream use case of jade we consider jammer localization specifically we demonstrate the potential for pinpointing jammer locations based on jammer activity detections in the mobile network using jade and combining them with cell site location data next section describes our datasets and evaluation metrics ii preliminaries a datasets a unique and noteworthy aspect of our work is the use of real 4g ran datasets from a multinational mobile network operator for our evaluations overall these datasets outlined below consist of about a million samples of radio network kpis measured at an hourly time resolution over

corresponds to periods with jammer activation events specifically it is made up of three subdatasets each corresponding to a different jammers activity over a 3 week period these three jammers are arbitrarily named by the operator as j16 j17 and j22 among these j16 affects three frequency bands mhz mhz 2500 2520 mhz and has a discontinuous onoff activation pattern on the other hand j17 and j22 have continuous activation patterns which means once activated they stay active until they are switched off j17 and j22 operate on 25002520 mhz and mhz bands respectively all these three sub datasets are manually labeled by radio network engineers from the operator with groundtruth on jammer activeabsent for each sample these groundtruth labels are key to our study in that they enable evaluation of different jammer detection methods considered in this paper overall the testing dataset consists of 255600 samples with groundtruth annotated kpi data kpis captured in each sample are same as in the training dataset each of the three subdatasets contain data for at least 50 cells for the above datasets we have conducted preprocessing steps to impute missing values with the average of neighboring values and normalized each kpi value via minmax normalization we did further feature extraction based on the timeseries of the above listed kpis following a similar methodology to the one in 17 which led to 82 features in all besides the datasets described above the proposed jade framework and constituent jammer detection methods are validated through trials on the operator side in ivc we present results for two additional different jammers labeled j23 and j19 encountered during the field trial period in the case study on jammer localization based on jammer detection events ivd we also use the groundtruth location data for j16 j17 and j22 jammers along with the location data of surrounding cell tower sites from the operator to assess jammer localization accuracy b evaluation metrics here we describe our metrics to evaluate the various jammer detection methods developedconsidered in this paper these fig 2 relative importance of different features kpis for the random forests based classifier metrics are defined in terms of four possible outcomes that can result from applying a jammer detection method which are truepositive tp jammer activity detected when such activity is actually present as per the groundtruth falsepositive fp jammer activity detected when in fact there is no jammer activity truenegative tn jammer activity not detected when jammer activity is absent as per the groundtruth falsenegative fn jammer activity not detected even though jammer is actually active an effective jammer detection method minimizes both fps and fns two commonly used measures to assess the extent to which a given method achieves these goals are precision andrecall1 as defined below precision tp tp fp1 recall tp tp fn2 higher values for both these metrics are desired a lower value of precision equivalently a higher number of fps leads to an increase in opex to diagnose confirm and localize jammer activity eg by field visits and testing when in reality there is none on the other hand a lower value of recall equivalently a high number of fns shows that the method in question fails to detect all jammer activation events and thus risks prolonged degradation of user qoe until the jammer activity is eventually detected and stopped given the above having high precision and high recall are equally important as such we consider a composite metric called f1score that weighs precision and recall equally by taking a harmonic mean of the two as defined below f1score 2 1 precision1 recall3",

effectiveness of supervised binary classification approach towards jammer detection in operational mobile networks considering rf as the classifier since we need a labeled dataset for training and testing with supervised classification we use one of our testing sub datasets for the j16 jammer outlined in section iia for this study each sample in this dataset is a 9tuple kpi data labeled as jammer activeabsent the dataset overall spans over 60 cells across three different frequency bands 35 cells in 1745 1765mhz 17 cells in 17651775mhz and 9 cells in 2500 2520mhz it is a fairly balanced dataset with 60 40 jammer active inactive samples we do a 7030 split of this dataset to create training and test data for the rf based binary classifier which leads to a test set with 11 cells in 1745 1765mhz 5 in 17651775mhz 3 in 25002520mhz we first use the rf feature importance 24 test to examine the relative importance of the different features from the classifiers perspective with the results shown in fig 2 we find that the average uplink rssi is the most important feature followed by uldl traffic volumes and throughputs interestingly the percentage of volte drops has the least predictive effect on the classifier perhaps because call drops could happen due to a myriad of factors beyond the jammer presence eg due to network overload or coverage issues fig 3 shows the box plot results for precision recall and f1 score metrics separately for each frequency band where the j16 jammer operates with each box plot capturing the distribution for the metric across different cells we observe that precision and recall values are less than ideal and range between 07 08 and 055075 respectively the relatively lower recall results indicate that this supervised classifier method errs more towards missing some jammer activation events than causing false alarms the combined effect measured by f1score is worse with a median value between 05 and 07 crucially this poor classification performance is noticed for cases with fewer cells and less data in the training dataset this highlights a key issue with supervised classification based approach to jammer detection more and diverse labeled data is needed compared to getting normal class data it is difficult and very costly to produce a large and diverse labeled dataset with jammer activation events more data can be available for normal periods as reflected by our datasets where 700000 samples or at least 70 of the total data is for the normal category but supervised classifiers fail to take advantage of such data fig 3 precision recall and f1score performance of random forests based supervised binary classifier b jade overview the foregoing discussion not only highlights limitations with the supervised classification based approach but a key challenge to be addressed in jammer detection method design ie limited or no data labeled with jammer effect another challenge is that there exist numerous types of jammers and each has its own different characteristics and impact on mobile network performance eg due to affecting different sets of frequency bands gathering training data that represents all jammer types is simply impractical moreover identifying the decision boundary between normal network behavior and that affected by jammer activity through the radio network kpis is challenging due to the inherent kpi dynamics our proposed jade framework illustrated in fig 4 addressestheabovechallengesjadeisenvisionedforoperator side deployment and considers cells at each tower site as measurement vantage points to aid in online jammer detection it relies on continual monitoring of time series of various kpis at each of these cells and collecting this data at the operator randatalakefacilitythisdataisthenpreprocessedtoaddress issues such as missing values by imputing with neighboring ones before putting it through the jammer detection pipeline in jade jade approaches jammer detection in an operational mobile network as a timeseries anomaly detection problem 1315 by considering that jammer activity manifests as abnormal or anomalous in the time series of radio network kpis to address the aforementioned challenges jade adopts the semisupervised form of anomaly detection 13 by solely relying on and leveraging potentially abundant normal data for model training this also makes jade independent of the type and behavior of a jammer thereby enabling robust detection across diverse types of jammers at the core of jade are two alternative deep learning based anomaly detection models besides jade incorporates an adaptive mechanism for these models to set thresholds that represent the boundary between normal and anomalous samples also rather than have a separate anomaly jammer detection model per cell or frequency band jade employs transfer learning 16 towards onecell and frequency band agnostic model we elaborate on the above components of jade in the following subsections c deep learning models for celllevel anomaly detection here we describe the two anomaly detection based models we develop as part of jade for jammer activity detection

25 based model 2 rssi prediction based model both these models operate at the cell level and take multivariate time series data for radio network kpis as input but aim to detect anomalous samples in the time series through different approaches as elaborated below since we are dealing with timeseries data we use lstm 26 cells in the architecture of both models 1autoencoder ae based anomaly detection model fig 5a illustrates the proposed lstm autoencoder based model that takes multivariate time series as input the core idea is to encode each input sample using an lstm network and decode it using another lstm network anomaly detection relies on the inability to faithfully decode the input sample with a sufficient amount of training data ie normal samples the ae model learns to reconstruct the normal samples the reconstruction error for normal samples will therefore be lower compared to the reconstruction error of samples in the presence of a jammer as mentioned above the ae model has two components an encoder and a decoder the encoder represents the input sample in the latent space whereas the decoder aims to reconstructs the latent domain back to the input sample the encoder in our model consists of four layers the number of lstm cells in the first layer is equal to the number of features in the input sample while the following three layers have 512 64 and 4 lstm

layers where the number of lstm cells in its first three layers are 4 64 and 512 respectively the number of lstm cells in the last layer of the decoder equals the input sample size in terms of features to the ae model we use mean squared error mse as a loss function and trained the model for 20 epochs for every cell in the training dataset we empirically optimize the hyperparameters with grid search 24 we use rmsprop as an optimizer and relu as an activation function with a batch size of 64 since the network kpis have inherent noise and variations we did not introduce any additional noise in the input of the ae towards better generalization 2rssi prediction based anomaly detection model we now present an alternative anomaly detection model for jammer activity detection that focuses on predicting the uplink rssi over time considering that this kpi is seen to be the most fig 5 a autoencoder based anomaly detection model b rssi prediction based anomaly detection model important feature in our earlier study on supervised binary classification based jammer detection fig 2 the essential idea here is to train a timeseries prediction model that takes as input multivariate time series of kpis and predicts the rssi for each following time step the prediction error is expected to be low for normal samples as the model is trained with data consisting of such samples but the presence of jammer activity can yield higher prediction errors which can then be identified as anomalies jammer activation events fig 5b illustrates our rssi prediction based anomaly detection model which leverages the stateoftheart lstm based time series prediction model architecture our model consists of four lstm layers the input layer three hidden lstm layers and one fully connected output layer the lstm cells in the input layer are equal to the number of features in each input sample the following three hidden layers have 32 16 and 8 lstm cells respectively the output layer is a fully connected dense layer with a single neuron that outputs rssi predictions specifically our model predicts the rssi for the following 10 time steps based on multivariate kpi time series for the past 10 time steps along a moving window like in the ae model the hyperparameters are experimentally optimized with grid search relu is used as an activation function and the batch size is 64 3 single and multikpi models we consider two variants of the above described models single kpi model that considers only one kpi specifically rssi in essence ae and rssi prediction versions of this model deal with rssi kpi time series note that each sample in the input time series to these models is multivariate with 74 different features due to feature extraction during data preprocessing multikpi model that considers all 9 kpis in our dataset including other kpis like uplinkdownlink throughput and rach success rate this is naturally a multivariate time series with 82 features in each sample of the input time series again due to the feature extraction step these single and multikpi models allow us to understand the added benefit of considering the various different kpis beyond just the uplink rssi d adaptive thresholding the two anomaly detection models described in the previous subsection produce a reconstructionprediction error for each new sample in a cell kpi time series but

need a threshold error level representing the boundary between normal and anomalous samples correctly setting this threshold is equally key to effective jammer detection it can be seen as deciding the tradeoff between fp and fn probabilities different approaches are taken for this thresholding in the literature some works do this manually relying on human expert feedback to setadapt thresholds eg 2729 but this is unviable in our setting feng et al 30 simply use the median reconstruction error as the threshold which is again not robust most recent wireless anomaly detection works however approachthisthresholdingbyassumingthaterrorsaregenerated from a gaussian distribution some of these works 3133 set the threshold based on a desired fp probability which is not appropriate in our setting as we also would like to have equally good precision and recall performance other works 3436 adopt a nthresholding approach for some small value of nwhere is the standard deviation of the error distribution this essentially means that a sample is considered an anomaly if its error reconstructionprediction error in our case is more than naway from the mean of the error distribution obtained using normal training data while the reconstructionprediction errors across all samples in the training data also follow a gaussian distribution in our case results not shown due to space limit we find the nthresholding approach is not robust in our setting as we show shortly we observe that this is because of the diversity among cells and so the impact of a jammer on those cells is also different there also exist other works eg 37 that empirically obtain a fixed threshold we instead take a tailored adaptive thresholding approach on a per cell basis by examining the time series of reconstructionprediction errors in each cell to detect anomalies our proposed approach to this issue can be seen as an adaptation of grubbs test 38 for single outlier detection in univariate data note that the data for thresholding purposes refers to either reconstruction or prediction errors depending on the anomaly detection model used and it is therefore univariate in the following we describe our proposed thresholding method we start by defining two hypotheses h0 there are no outliers in the data and h1 there is exactly one outlier in the data we also define grubbs test statistic to be calculated fig 7 average rssi distribution across cells using different uplink frequency bands for each new data error sample yi gcalc maxy iy s4 where yands respectively represent the mean and

on the j16 ul mhz test dataset e transfer learning our proposed solution for detecting jammer activity via anomaly detection model with adaptive thresholding approach thus far implicitly considered a single cell scenario in practice however each cell tower site hosts multiple cells possibly configured on different frequency bands moreover an operators network deployment may have thousands of such cell sites but training and maintaining a per cell or even per frequency band anomaly detection models is not scalable from a deployment perspective we therefore aim at a single cell and frequency agnostic anomaly detection model one per each alternative discussed in iiic we cannot however base such a model by training it on single cell or even single frequency band as different cells and frequency bands have diverse behavior in terms of radio network kpis and jammer effect for example the rssi distributions across cells on different uplink frequency bands shown in fig 7 clearly highlight such diversity so we train our target cell and frequency agnostic model using normal data from different cells and frequency bands to make this training efficient we leverage transfer learning tl 16 specifically we train the cell and frequency agnostic model as follows we start with a frequency band and a cell within that band once the model is trained with data for that cell we treat that as the start point for training on a different cell from the same frequency band reusing the already trained models weights as opposed to starting from scratch once the model is trained across all cells of a frequency band then it is used as the base model for training on cells for another frequency band we repeat this process until we cover all frequency bands and cells in the training data which ultimately results in the frequency and cell agnostic model iv evaluation in this section we evaluate the performance of the proposed jade framework using the operator provided 4g ran datasets described in iiain terms of the precision recall and f1score metrics defined in iib a comparative evaluation of anomaly detection methods in the previous section we have already presented evaluation results that show the effectiveness of the adaptive thresholding mechanism in jade here we evaluate the different anomaly fig 9 performance of baseline ad methods on the j16 ul mhz test dataset detection ad model alternatives in jade relative to commonly used ad methods 13 39 recall from iiicthat the jade framework offers four different ad models ae and rssi prediction based models each with single and multikpi versions we train these models using the training dataset iia we evaluate using the j16 ul mhz part of the testing dataset for comparison we consider five diverse and commonly used ad methods zscore local outlier factor oneclass svm robust covariance and isolation forest to make these baseline methods work with our multidimensional kpi data we use principal component analysis pca 40 based dimensionality reduction to represent the dataset in twodimensional space fig 8 shows the performance comparison between the four jadead modelswe observe that themultikpi version ofae based ad model performs worse than the other three models especially in terms of recall however the single kpi version specifically rssi of the ae model relatively performs much better we attribute this to the characteristics of kpis other than rssi that allow reconstruction even in jammer presence resulting in some jammer activations going undetected rssi prediction based ad models both perform well with higher than 09 values in all three metrics the multikpi version of rssi prediction based model offers the best performance overall which suggests that considering all kpis is beneficial although marginally relatively the baseline methods perform quite poorly with values for all metrics less than 06 which is no better than the random guess based on the known probability of jammer activation events in the test dataset as prior fig 9 these results provide a convincing justification for developing tailored ad methods for kpi based jammer detection as we do in jade b robustness across diverse frequencies jammer types so far we have considered the jade performance on one uplink frequency band j16 ul1800 and with jammer type j16 here we evaluate across different frequency bands and jammer types to assess its robustness for this study we consider the best performing model from the previous experiment as the jade ad model the multikpi version of rssi prediction based ad model we first compare the jammer detection performance between frequencyspecific and frequencyagnostic versions of the chosen jade ad model on different frequencies that

frequencyagnostic model though marginallyworsethanitsfrequencyspecificcounterpartsyields greater than 09 value for all metrics in more than 90 of the cells the training time from using tl relative to not using it is shown in fig 11 which clearly demonstrates the training efficiency gain that tl provides to study robustness of jade jammer detection performance we apply the tl based frequencyagnostic model as in the previous experiment on j17 and j22 parts of the testing dataset results shown in fig 12 clearly confirm the effectiveness of jade for these other jammer types the root of the robustness property of jade lies in its design choice to rely on semisupervised form of anomaly detection training only on normal data c field validation so far our evaluation of jade performance was based on operator provided data labeled with groundtruth on jammer activity ie the testing dataset in iia we now present results validating jade performance in the field at the operator side for this purpose we provided the radio network engineers at the operator with the implementation of jades tl based frequencyagnostic ad model as in the last experiment it was used to reliably detect a different type of jammer j23 with discontinuous activation pattern as shown in fig 13 jade was also used at the operator side to detect a military grade jammer j19 targeting different uplink frequencies due to the complex nature of this jammer activity it was not practical like with j23 to manually label the groundtruth by the operators radio engineers nevertheless we visually demonstrate in fig 14 how jade is able to detect jammer activity on a sample cell affected by this jammer during the fig 12 the performance of tl based frequencyagnostic jade ad model on j17

localization case study here we briefly discuss a case study for jade on jammer localizationtheideaistousethejammerdetectionresultswith jade in conjunction with cell site location data to estimate a jammers location jammer localization is a kind of transmitter localization problem as cell sites surrounding a jammer detect its activity with jade as receivers and it can be localized based on sensed signals at those sites as our purpose here is not on jammer localization algorithm design per se but rather on showing the usefulness of jade for such downstream task we consider three most commonly used transmitterlocalizationalgorithms41maxrssicentroidand weighted centroid with max rssi the location of the cell site where jammer is detected with max rssi is taken as jammers location estimate with weighted centroid rssi weighted geometric center of cell site locations that detect the jammer is estimated as the jammer location we use the groundtruth jammer locations provided by the operator to calculate location estimation errors as euclidean distance between groundtruth and estimated locations fig 16a shows the obtained results for j16 j17 and j22 jammers in our testing dataset while fig 16b zooms in on the results for j17 case even with these commonly used localization algorithms we find that jammers can be localized within a few hundred meters of the groundtruth which is sufficient in practice for radio engineers to pinpoint the source of jamming activity between the three jammers considered j16 is located in the country side with sparser mobile network 1146authorized

distinguishing different types of jamming attacks more recent works in this line of research focus on machine learningbased jammer detection 1820 22 45 with most of them taking a supervised

presents a threat assessment of the lte system that identifies the weakest points in its physical phy layer while 46 47 observe that jamming the uplink is more effective for an attacker than the downlink due to the relatively lower transmission power limit for lte ues in the former we are unaware of any previous work that leverages kpi data to detect jammers in mobile networks by treating

due to packets collisions and one of the main reasons for that is the rulebased phy layer transmission parameters assignment algorithms lorawan is a leading lpwan technology where lora serves as the physical layer here we propose and evaluate a deep reinforcement learning drlbased phy layer transmission parameter assignment algorithm for lorawan our algorithm ensures fewer collisions and better network performance com pared to the existing stateoftheart phy layer transmission parameter assignment algorithms for lorawan our algorithm outperforms the state of the art learningbased technique achieving up to 500 improvement of pdr in some cases i i ntroduction over the next few years the internet of things iot networks are expected to grow exponentially most iot end devices eds are expected to be i lowcost ii longrange and iii ultralowpower these eds will provide vital information for intelligent decision making in many smart applications in diverse fields such as healthcare systems inventory manage ment and smart parking the large number of eds deployed in such networks poses significant challenges such as low packet delivery ratio pdr and high overall power consumption due to these challenges there is a need for an effective commu nication technique that can enable simultaneous transmissions from several devices while i reducing packet collisions and ii keeping power consumption low longrange lora is a lowpower wideareanetwork lp wan protocol that enables multiple simultaneous transmis sions through customization of phy layer transmission param eters lorawan 1 is the open mac layer specification for lora lorawan uses pure aloha as the mac protocol primarily because a simple protocol better suits lowpower eds as aloha does not sense a communication channel before transmission therefore with an increase in data traffic load the network performance deteriorates in the light of the above dis cussion loras ability of phy layer parameter customization can become helpful as an intelligent phy layer transmission parameter assignment algorithm can not only make up for alohas performance issues it can also result in lower power consumption due to reduced number of collisions a decision of selecting an appropriate phy layer transmis sion parameter such as spreading factor channel frequency andpower is impacted by a number of factors a couple of most important factors in this regard are i channel condition and ii distance of an ed from a gateway it is a wellknown fact that interference and data traffic load is not constant hence the channel

adversarial lens muhammad usama inaam ilahi and junaid qadir information technology university lahore 54000 pakistan rupendra nath mitra and mahesh k marina the university of edinburgh edinburgh eh8 9yl uk spurred by the recent advances in deep learning to harness rich information hidden in large volumes of data and to tackle problems that are hard to modelsolve eg resource allocation problems there is currently tremendous excitement in the mobile networks domain around the transformative potential of datadriven artificial intelligencemachine learning aiml based network automation control and analytics for 5g and beyond in this article we present a cautionary perspective on the use of aiml in the 5g context by highlighting the adversarial dimension spanning multiple types of ml supervisedunsupervisedreinforcement learning and support this through three case studies we also discuss approaches to mitigate this adversarial ml risk offer guidelines for evaluating the robustness of ml models and call attention to issues surrounding ml oriented research in 5g more generally aconsiderable amount of industry and aca demic rd endeavors are currently paving the way toward 5g and beyond 5g b5g networks 5g networks unlike their 4g counter parts are foreseen to be the underpinning infra structure for a diverse set of future cellular services well beyond mobile broadband to span multiple vertical industries to flexibly and cost effectively support diverse usecases and to enable complex network functions at scale 5g network design espouses several innovations and technolo gies such as arti ficial intelligence ai along with softwarede fined networking network function vir tualization nfv multiaccess edge computing mec and cloudnative architecture that are new to the domain of mobile telecommunications technical developments toward 5g and b5g of mobile networks are quickly embracing a variety of deep learning dl algorithms as a de facto approach to help tackle the growing complexities of the network problems however the wellknown vulnerability of the dl models to the adversarial machine learning mlattacks can signi ficantly contribute to broadening the overall attack surface for 5g and beyond networks this observation motivates us to deviate from the on going trend of developing a newer ml model to address a 5g network problem and instead examine the robustness of the existing ml models in relation to the 5g networks under adversarial ml attacks in particular we focus on representative use cases for deep neural network dnn driven supervised learning sl unsupervised learning ul and reinforcement learning rl techniques in the 5g setting and high light their brittleness when subject to adversarial ml attacks through this article we would like to draw the attention of the research community and all stake holders of 5g and beyond mobile networks to seri ously consider the security risks that emerge from the rapid unvetted adoption of dl algorithms across the wide spectrum of network operations control and automation and urge to make robustness of the ml models a criterion before they are integrated into deployed systems overall we make the following two contributions 1",

challenging task many approaches for defending against these attacks are available in the literature but these techniques are shown ineffective against newer variations of the attacks6the following are a few recommendations for designing a defensive inter vention against adversarial examples a generic defense that can defend against any type of adversarial attack is not possible so the first logical step is to understand the threat model of the system for which the defensive intervention is needed in many cases the adversarial examples are gen eratedsampled from a distribution similar to the legitimate data a preemptive data generation process by using generative models and aggres sive labeling labeling the preemptively generatedexamples as false positives can improve the odds of detecting many adversarial attacks in our previ ous work12we have shown that this procedure can help in making a better defense deploy all known procedures from the literature that is in line with the threat model always design defenses considering adaptive adversaries evaluating a defense in the following we have provided a few important evaluation guidelines for evaluating the mlbased 5g applications against adversarial ml attacks these insights are extracted from the carlini et al19and our previous works620 many defenses are available in the literature against adversarial attacks but these defenses are limited by the design of the application using them without considering the threat model of mlbased 5g applications can create a false sense of security so for mlbased 5g applications threat models must clearly state the assumptions taken type of the adversary and the metrics used for evaluating the defense always test the defense against the strongest known attack and use it as a baseline evaluating for an adaptive adversary is also necessary evaluate the defense procedure for gradient based gradientfree and random noisebased attacks httpswwwrobustmlorg clearly state the evaluation parameters accu racy recall precision f1 score receiver operat ing characteristic curve roc etc used in evaluatingvalidating the defense and always look for a change in the false

entire fields of vision language speech and information processing many proponents are optimistic that ml will play a central role in enabling the future selfdriving cognitive networks by comprehensively automating the cognitive net working tasks such as realtime telemetry network automation network intent modeling and net work decision making a broad illustration of the various tasks involved in the operations of cognitive selfdriving networks is provided in fig 1 many of these highlighted tasks require a datadriven learning and inference process hence they can benefit from using a ml pipeline involving methods such as deep super vised ml and reinforcement learning however despite the great promise and suc cess of ml methods the recent discovery of the susceptibility of ml models to security problems has dampened the optimism around the use of ml in cognitive networking the major reasons for the security vulnerabilities of ml models are the underlying implicit

perturbation of the input that an adversary especially crafts to maximize the prediction error of the ml model 2 deep neural networks dnns in particular have been shown to be very vulnerable to such adversarial examples 3 it is worth noting that dnns are not the only ml models vulnerable to adversarial examples the problem is much broader and many other ml systems including reinforcementlearning rl and generative models 4 are also susceptible to adversarial examples adversarial ml is now a fastexpanding field attracting significant attention from the industry and academia 4 although ml vulnerabilities in domains such as vision image and audio are now well known relatively little attention has focused on adversarial attacks on cognitive networking ml models an illustration of the ml pipeline in cognitive selfdriving networks along with poten tial security attacks that may be launched on its components is depicted next in fig 2 due to the rising popularity of cognitive net working and selfdriving networks ml models used in the context of cognitive networks have become highprofile targets for malevolent adver saries who are interested in compromising the integrity and availability of these ml models the resulting threat becomes more serious when cog nitive networking breaks through into safetycrit ical networks such as selfdriving vehicles and vehicular networks

mostly based on reinforcement learning are left as a future direction we also propose a concrete novel networkspecifi c adversarial ml attack on an anomalybased intrusion detection system and network traffic classification to highlight potential issues that may arise when adversarial ml attacks are launched on future mlbased cognitive selfdriving networks for cognitive networking to really take off it is extremely important that the underlying technology has to be robust to all kinds of potential problems be they accidental intentional or adversarial background in this section we discuss the challenges posed by adversarial ml attacks and then propose a taxonomy of adversarial ml attacks we will then survey the proposed adversarial attacks and defenses after that we highlight the stateoftheart in adversarial ml attacks on selfdriving cognitive networks to emphasize that this area of research needs special attention as networking moves from traditional networking to selfdriving cognitive networks challenges posed by adversarial ml a ttacks ml adds substantially to the worries of security practitioners by expanding an alreadybroad attack surface comprising standard but still potent attacks in addition the future denselyconnected iotera cognitive networking will likely expose new vulnerabilities and a wider attack surface through its emphasis on massive connectivity previous research has shown that a motivated wellresourced adversary can arbitrarily alter data and labels to compromise ml models completely and induce an error rate of up to 100 percent 5 another important reason for adversarial ml attacks is the lack of a better understanding of how modern ml frameworks such as dnns operate multiple explanations for the sensitivity of the ml models to adversarial examples have been provided in the literature 4 including the nonlinearity of the dnn models which can assign random labels in areas that are underexplored in the training set but such a hypothesis fails to explain the transferability 1 of adversarial examples from one ml model to another in addition it is not only the nonlinear dnn models that suffer from these attacks but linear models have also been shown to be vulnerable to adversarial examples 4 while the reasons for the capitulation of the ml models to adversarial examples are still not well known it is clear that these adversarial attacks pose a grave danger to the security of future cognitive networks which requires immediate attention from the community adversarial examples are especially challeng ing due to the asymmetric nature of adversarial ml attacks the asymmetry implies that the job of the defender is to secure the entire attack surface all the time but the attacker only has to fi nd a single kink in the surface the attacker also attacks surreptitiously much like in guerrilla warfare using previouslyunseen attacks at a time of its own choosing the attacker constructs these attacks creatively by adding adversarial noise to incur the worstcase domain shifts in the input in a bid to elicit incorrect results by the ml model this stacks the odds in favor of the attacker and the battle becomes a manifestly unfair one to prove that the ml model is secure against attacks the defender has to anticipate the threat models and provide formal proof that demonstrates the fortitude to withstand the assumed threats with the well known attacks proposed in the literature 5 the bar of eff ort required for launching new attacks has lowered since the same canned attacks can be used by others although sommer and paxson 6 were probably right in 2010 to downplay the potential of security attacks on ml saying exploiting the specifi cs of a machine learning implementation requires significant eff ort time and expertise on the attackers side the danger is real now when an attack can be launched on mlbased implementations with minimal eff ort time and expertise taxonomy of security attacks on machine learning in this section we aim to communicate the big picture of adversarial ml security by referring to the ml pipeline for cognitive networking fig 2 and a taxonomy of adversarial ml related issues that we developed fig 3 based on the attacks location on the ml pipe line security attacks on ml models can be classifi ed into two categories first in a poisoning or training attack the attacker can access and adversarially poison the training data in a bid to maximize the classification error attacks during the training phase can also include theft of the intellectual property ip if the training is outsourced figure 1 the cognitive selfdriving networking components and their related tasks are highlighted to provide the reader with a basic understanding of how cognitive selfdriving networks can be realized supervised and reinforcement learning techniques are expected to play a vital role in achieving most of the tasks real time telemetrydatadriv en analysis netw ork decision makingoperatorus er intent actions traffic logs logs deploy ednetwork 1 the transferability of an adversarial example refers to the property that adversarial examples produced to mislead a particular ml model can be used to mislead other ml models as well even if their architectures greatly diff er from each other this article has been accepted for inclusion in a future issue of this magazine content is final as presented with the exception of paginationieee network accepted for publication 3to some external provider second in an evasion or inference attack on the other hand the attacks attempt to perturb the textinference input through the creation of adversarial examples to compromise the ml model the attacks can also attempt to steal the ml model ip through a side channel through successive polling other types of attacks may involve obtaining physical access and intrusion into the hardware based on the adversarys knowledge adver sarial ml attacks can be categorized into two types in a whitebox attack it is assumed that the adversary has perfect knowledge of the ml architecture trainingtesting data and the hyperparameters of the model in contrast in a blackbox attack it is considered that the adversary has partial access or no access to the deployed model based on the knowledgeaccess of the adversary blackbox attacks are further divided into two categories namely querybased attacks and zeroquery attacks a blackbox attack where an adversary can act as a standard user and query the ml model for a response and later use that queryresponse pair to generate an adversarial example is known as a querybased attack the zeroquery attack is defined as a blackbox attack where the adversary has no access to the deployed ml model but has only a few test samples available to craft adversarial examples against a deployed ml model based on the adversarial intent specifi city we can further divide evasion attacks into two classes in a targeted attack the attacker aims to fool the ml classifi er to classify all adversarial samples in one class by maximizing the probability of the targeted attack for example an adversary that wants to disguise the intrusive traffic as normal network traffi c can create a perturbation that maximizes the classifi cation probability of the normal traffic class in a nontargeted attack the attacker aims to fool the ml classifier by assigning an adversarial sample to any other class except the original one these attacks are performed by minimizing the probability of the original class that ensures that the adversarial sample will not get classifi ed in the original class all classifi cation schemes depicted in the tax onomy are directly related to the intentgoal of the adversary most of the existing adversarial ml attacks are whitebox attacks which are later converted to blackbox attacks by exploiting the transferability property of adversarial examples 7 the transferability property of adversarial ml means that adversarial perturbations generated for one ml model will often mislead other unseen ml models related research has been carried out on adversarial pattern recognition for more than a decade and even before that there was a smattering of works focused on performing ml in the presence of malicious errors 5 brief review of the adversarial ml l iterature adversarial ml attacks proposed in lit erature ml models especially those that are dnnbased are very vulnerable to adversarial perturbations an adversarial sample x is created by adding a small carefully crafted perturbation dto the correctly classifi ed sample x the perturba tion d is calculated by approximating the optimi zation problem given in equation 1 iteratively until the crafted adversarial example gets classifi ed by ml classifi er f in targeted class t xxarg min xfxt 1 in 2013 szegedy et al 7 reported that the dnn inputoutput mapping is fairly discontinuous and dnns are not robust to small perturbations in the input this triggered an extraordinary interest in adversarial ml attacks in 2014 goodfellow et al 8 proposed a nontargeted elementwise adversarial example generation method where the adversarial perturbation is generated by performing only a singlestep gradient update in the direction of the gradient at each element of the input example this method of generating adversarial ml attacks is called the fast gradient sign method fgsm kurakin et al 9 proposed the basic iterative method bim attack which improves the fgsm attack by introducing an iterative small perturbation optimization method for generating adversarial examples paperfigure 2 the ml pipeline in cognitive networking through which we learn insights from raw network telemetry data by passing it through

attacks by exploiting the property of transferability of adversarial examples more details on available adversarial ml attacks and their applications are reviewed in 4 12 adversarial ml defenses proposed in the lit erature in response to adversarial ml attacks researchers have come up with some defenses some of which focus on detection while others focus on prevention generally defenses against adversarial examples are divided into two broader categories as shown in fig 3 these categories are reactive defenses and proactive defenses reac tive defenses involve retraining or reconfiguring the ml model after the adversarial ml attack or timely detection of the adversarial attack in order to save critical information proactive defenses involve preemption of adversarial attacks and preparing the ml model to defend against them the three major techniques of proactive defens es are adversarial training feature squeezing and defensive distillation the technique of adversarial training proposed by goodfellow et al 8 requires that classifiers be preemptively trained on adversarial perturba tions this defense provides robustness against adversarial examples the classifier is trained on but any perturbation on which the classifier has not been trained can still evade the classifier xu et al 13 proposed feature squeezing as another approach for hardening the ml schemes against adversarial attacks feature squeezing is a pro cess of reducing the search space available to the adversary by fusing samples that correspond to different feature vectors in the original space into a single sample another solution called network distillation was proposed by papernot et al 11 as a defense against adversarial perturbations which focused on hiding the gradients between the presoftmax and the softmax output to pro vide robustness against gradientbased attacks on dnns this defense however was breached by carlini et al 10 who proposed adversarial perturbation techniques that successfully evaded defensive distillation based dnns even though the onerous job of thwarting attacks currently appears to be a sisyphean task with no end in sight for example although one can use adversarial training to train a dnn this is a onestep solution since further adversarial exam ples can still be constructed for the new dnn model starting a cat and mouse game the reali zation of the cognitive networking vision requires and should motivate the development of robust ml solutions the advers arial ml challenge for cogn itive networks adversarial ml attacks have not yet been explored thoroughly for cognitive networking although a few works have highlighted the adver sarial ml threat for cognitive networks especially the realtime network telemetry component of

this section we present a concrete adversarial ml attack that is specific to networking applica tions instead of focusing broadly on the expansive functional area of realtime telemetry of cognitive selfdriving networking we limit our focus to using ml for two surrogate realtime telemetry cognitive networking problems anomalybased intrusion detection and network traffic classification the purpose of these case studies is to highlight the ease with which an adversarial ml attack can be launched and to show that many cognitive network ing based ml applications in their current form may not provide any robustness against adversarial per turbations while our explicit focus is on ids and network traffic classification applications our insights apply more broadly to diverse supervised unsuper vised and reinforcement learning techniques we formulated the network anomalybased intrusion detection problem as a binary classifi cation problem where the classification is per formed between two classes namely normal or dos denial of services svm and dnn are employed for performing the classification task the reason for selecting svm and dnn to per form classification is to highlight the fact that both traditional and more recent ml techniques svm and dnn respectively are highly susceptible to small carefullycrafted adversarial examples for the network traffic classification we for mulated it as a multiclass classification problem where the classification is performed between ten network traffic classes namely www mail bulk serv db int p2p attack mmedia and

where by definition the adversary has complete knowledge about the classifiers architecture hyperparameters and test data we trained an svm classifier with the radial basis function rbf kernel and utilized stochastic gradient descent for learning the parameters of the dnn adversary goal we assume that the adver sary wants to compromise the integrity and availability of the deployed ml based intrusion detection and traffic classification systems for the ids case study the adversary perturbs the anomalous traffic ie dos class while ensur ing the functional behavior in such a way that the classifier mistakes it as a normal traffic class for the traffic classification case study the goal of the adversary is to perturb the mail traffic in such a way that the classifier misclassifies it in any other traffic class although we used the mail class to perform the adversarial ml attack the proposed attack works equally well for any other target class in the dataset advers arial sample

the normal and the dos class es once the most discriminant features are identified we reduce the distance between them by using constrained l 1 norm minimiza tion on the discriminant feature set of the dos traffic to form a perturbation d the calcu lated perturbation d is then added to a dos test example x to create an adversarial dos sample x when the adversarial sample x is subjected to the

researchers in other application domains have started to work on robustbydesign models and algorithms and we should have similar if not higher standards for cognitive networking applications there does not exist much work on guidelines for evaluating the defenses against adversarial ml attacks particularly against cognitive networks in the following we provide some guidelines leveraging the insights shared by carlini et al 10 on how to effectively evaluate the robustness of ml schemes check the adversarial threat model used in the defense under review for evaluating what kind of knowledge the adversary has about the targeted ml model does the defense under review consider the presence of an adaptive adversary in the selfdriving cognitive networking environ ment does the defense under review provide robustness against gradientbased adversarial attacks evaluate the defense under consideration using different threat model assumptions and for different performance metrics evaluate the defense under consideration against strong adversarial attacks ie optimi zationbased attacks and not against weak attacks out of distribution adversarial exam ples transferable adversarial examples to check whether the transferability property of adversarial examples is blocked or not develop ing new metrics for ml in cogn itive networks traditionally the metric used to evaluate the per formance of an ml model nearly always has been a variant of the metric of prediction accuracy that is how often is the model correct in its prediction or classification to be sure accuracy can be mea sured in various ways such as precision specifici ty sensitivity recall but using accuracy alone as a metric can only inform us of the averagecase per formance this has the implicit assumption that the distribution of the test data will be similar to the dis tribution of the training data this assumption obvi ously fails to hold when an adversary intentionally changes the test data with the explicit goal of defeat ing the ml model there is therefore a need to also focus on evaluating a systems worst case perfor mance and measure the adversarial resilience of the ml model we should move away from only using traditional ml metrics related to accuracy and preci sion toward a greater emphasis on robustness trans parency and resilience here we recommend some new metrics for ensuring the appropriate applica tion and validation of ml schemes in selfdriving cognitive networking there can be more metrics depending on the design of the mlbased selfdriv ing cognitive networking application inference stability this is a measure that com pares the output of the victims model before and after the adversarial attack inference stability is calculated by measuring the distribution similar ity before and after the adversarial attack and defense divergence to the average is a popular way of computing the similarity between distri butions for selfdriving cognitive networks infer ence stability will provide information about the attack and recovery of the system from the adver sarial ml attack classification confidence variance this is a measure intended to demonstrate how the model is impacted by the adversarial attack and defensive technique more precisely classifica tion confidence variance provides the change in the confidence of the classification of an example after the adversarial attack and after the adversarial defense is applied misclassification ratio this is a measure intended for quantifying the success of an adver sarial attack it gives a measure of how many adversarial examples have successfully evaded the classifier it is also an important measure from the defenders perspective as the misclassification ratio provides a quantitative measure for testing the defense against adversarial attacks semantic insights despite its success in other domains ml has traditionally not been as successful in terms of deployments in the real world for detecting anomalies one important reason behind this is that for anomaly detection semantic knowledge under lying the prediction and not only the prediction itself is

selfdriving cognitive networks unfortunately drl also lacks robustness against adversarial examples and it has been recently shown 5 that adversarial examples can affect the performance of drl the

        "prompt": "september 2019big data is not neutral nor is it objective one of the compelling aspects of big data is the assump tion that it is eliminating human subjectivity and bias although the idea of baggagefree learning is seductive data alone is not enough since there is no learning with out knowledge as a practical consequence of the no free lunch theorem big data analytics is what mathemati cians call an illposed problem thus no unique model exists1 the only way to resolve some illposed problems is to make additional assumptions these assumptions are subjective and can be thought of as being opinions embedded in math 36 therefore while data is often considered neutral data collection techniques and analy sis methods are designed by humans based on their knowledge experience and beliefs the german philosopher heidegger wrote everywhere we remain unfree and chained to technology whether we passionately affirm or deny it but we are delivered over to it in the worst possi ble way when we regard it as something neutral big data scientists make computations using data and present results about people in terms of numbers or mathematical relations based on layers upon layers of assumptions data scientists use this data and try to organize it into objects relations and events and in doing so invariably analyze the data within the back drop of their subjectivity and partiality moreover it is challenging to ensure fairness in ml algorithms due to significant statistical limitations and it is possible that enforcing fairness can harm the very groups that these algorithms were supposed to protect 10 opaque blackbox models many of the modern mathematical models used for big data analysis are opaque and unregulated 36 these models are often used inappropriately and can scale up biases thereby producing misleading results such models have even been referred to as weapons of maths destruction wmd due to their inscrutable black box nature these wmds can cause havocharm and tend to punish the poor due to vicious feedback loops 36 the reliance on opaque algorithmic black boxes for decision making is even more problematic when we consider how easy it is for adversaries to attack ml models new research attacks have emerged in which adversaries can trick ml models to make decisions as they desire something that has huge consequences for a society in which human decisions are automated and made by machines big datas big bias problem most big data datasets contain hidden biases both in collection and analysis stage these biases in data can create an illusion of reality these biases are hard to undo and their elimination have unintended conse quences on the results four major biases of big data are described as follows sampling bias when the samples are partial selec tive and not random the patterns of omitted informa tion may influence the structures discovered in the data such samples will be unable to accurately predict the outcomes and will have reduced validity 38 such bias is often found when we focus on sentiment analysis on social media safety monitoring using social media or use population statistics and tourism statistics activity bias this is another bias that is usually encountered in web data 29 this arises from the time based correlation of users activities across diverse web sites because most of the users visit a website for a while and never return during the measurement period this can be explained using the example of the model of ginsberg et al 18 for predicting flu cases using 50 million google search terms the model suffered from activity bias where it started overpredicting the flu in the us 9 28 information bias this refers to the delusion that more information always results in better decisions data scientists give too much significance on the vol ume of data and ignore other alternative opinions and solutions the irony of this belief is that fewer data can give better decisions in some situations in various cases a simple rule of thumb can work better than complex analysis there are situations where ignorance from very large data and required calculation can pro vide more accurate and faster results because large biased data just magnify the errors having more infor mation is not always more desirable inductive bias assuming the future will be like the past in big data analysis there is an implicit belief that the future can always be extrapolated based on histori cal data apart from this approach being philosophically 1a famous statistical quote by george box is all models are wrong some are usefulan uncritical acceptance and careless application of big data methods can adversely affect human welfare and development85 september 2019 ieee technology and society magazinedebatable cf the problem of induction such an approach can empirically backfire in many cases and result in invalid misleading or unhelpful analyses fooled by the big noise in 43 the author nate silver notes that even though data is increasing globally by 25 quintillion bytes each day useful information is of course not increas ing commensurately this means that most of the data is just noise and that noise is increasing faster than useful information a related problem is that of the curse of dimensionality where the more dimen sions one works with the less effective standard computational and statistical techniques become which has serious repercussions when we are dealing with big data as more data is generated and collect ed the complexity deviations variance or noise and the number of potential false findings grow expo nentially compared to the information or signal this spurious rise in data can mislead us to fake sta tistical relationships another point of concern is that a plethora of hypoth eses are tested using a single data in big data analytics which opens the door for spurious correlations when a large number of hypotheses are tested it becomes highly likely that some false results will become statisti cally significant which can mislead big data practitio ners if they are not careful the proper way to formulate a hypothesis is before the experiment not after it it is necessary to understand that the statistical signifi cance under an inaccurate method is totally specious ie significance tests do not protect against data dredging 45 apart from the problem of spurious correlations big data analysts can also become guilty of cherry picking in this phenomenon scientists tend to focus on finding support for their hypotheses and beliefs while overlook ing other evidence as a result they only present posi tive results of their experiments that endorse their hypothesis or argument instead of reporting all of the findings 34 in this way big data provide a relatively small advantage to improve public strategies policies and operations with minimum public benefit 8 are big data predictions generalizable in big data analytics datasets are mostly gathered from observational sources instead of a strict statisti cal experiment this poses the question of the gener alizability of the insights learned from this data notwithstanding the large size of the dataset even though we know that statistically speaking the dis crepancy in an estimate decreases with an increase in the sample size as bernoulli proved but the messi ness of realworld data in terms of incompleteness imbalance hidden bias rareness large variances outliers and nonindependent identically distributed iid nature means that simply getting more data is not sufficient disregard for the messiness of the real world data can mislead us into problems such as mul tiple testing regression to the mean selection bias and overinterpretation of causal associations 36 also we must note that certain things are not precise",

and the norms and expectations of people 7 therefore it is necessary to situate and contextualize data in such a way that minimizes privacy breaches without affecting its usefulness big data can bring more transparency both for indi viduals and organizations by introducing user anony mization but there are numerous examples when data is thought to be anonymous but its combination with other variables resulted in unexpected reidentification 2 27 42 for example it has been proved that four spatiotemporal points are sufficient to uniquely identify 95 of the individuals in a dataset where the location of an individual is specified hourly with a spatial resolution given by the carriers antennas 11 in another similar study latanya sweeney 46 argued that 87 of all big data provides opportunities for unscrupulous people groups government or organizations to use users personal data against them86 ieee technology and society magazine september 2019americans could be uniquely recognized using only three bits of information zip code birth date and sex the datasets being released today are anonymized by applying ad hoc deidentification methods therefore the possibility of reidentification depends heavily on the advancement of reidentification methods and avail ability of the auxiliary datasets to an adversary thus the chances of privacy breaches in the future are essen tially uncertain the allimportant consideration to be accounted for is how the collection of data may affect a persons well being and dignity and to ensure that basic human rights and human freedom are not impinged upon we should work actively to minimize potential risks related to the release of private confidential information and the mali cious use of data potentially by unauthorized agents quality of statistics numbers are soft and incentives matter data is not simply information that is harvested from an objective context it should be an institutionally cultur ally and socially shaped product collecting good quali ty data for development is in practice very costly as we need resources and manpower for data collection maintenance and monitoring 22 for instance the aggregate statistic for gross domestic product gdp in many subsaharan african countries is often measured approximately since most african countries are simply unable to collect all the information needed to calculate gdp accurately and changes are approximately inferred from rainfall figures or population growth 21 the use of this data can lead to distorted or misleading policy decisions by development agencies and governments and can contribute to the underestimation of gdp and bewildering fallouts such as the following 1 in november 2010 ghanas statistics service anno unced an estimated gdp that was off from its true value resulting in an upward adjustment of a whop ping 60 which was enough to change ghanas status from a lowincome country to a lower middle income country 232 similar adjustments were made in nigeria in april 2014 where the rise was almost 90 which caused the total gdp of subsaharan africa to rise by 20 21 but where did these overnight growth spurts come from and what to say about the fate of the analysis and policies of the various policymakers and development professionals that were based on the previous miscalcu lated data and the cost of this misplaced analysis the official statistics are often missing incomplete dated or unreliable given such concerns researchers have argued that the numbers cannot be taken at face value for development data from a place like africa resulting in what has been called africas statistical tragedy 21 pitfalls of selfmonitoring of states in the modern world almost every government tightly controls what kind of information is disseminated about the state an important aspect of the selfmoni toring of states is that it often becomes a farce because people cannot keep their own score the official statis tics measured by the government must be accepted with a pinch of salt since governments are spinning these numbers in ways that project the countrys prog ress positively since the legitimacy of the state depends on the popular understanding of the countrys prog ress the anthropologist james scott in his book see ing like a state 41 describes the ways in which governments in their fetish for quantification and data end up making peoples lives miserable rather than bet ter as development projects initiated by the states are aimed at improving human lives an appropriate mea sure for the development must be how much effort is expended on minimizing the risks associated with data collection and analysis human systems have complex loops with predictions being selffulfilling human social systems are complex adaptive systems with multiloop nonlinear feedback in which actions per formed for some purpose can lead to quite different unexpected and unintended consequences we will use two examples to illustrate the 1 unintended consequences and 2 selffulfilling nature of interven tions in complex social systems for our first example consider the cobra effect as an example of an incident in which an intervention crafted to ameliorate a problem actually aggravated it by pro ducing some unintended consequences during the brit ish colonial rule of india the government devised a bounty system for combating the rise of venomous cobras the system worked successfully initially and lots of snakes were killed for the reward but entrepreneurs the allimportant consideration to be accounted for is how the collection of data may affect a persons wellbeing and dignity87 september 2019 ieee technology and society magazinesoon figured out that they could make money by farm ing cobras and killing more of them the government on learning about this scrapped the system but ended up with a situation in which there were more cobras after the intervention than before for our second example consider the paper town effect in the 20th century a famous map of new york was created by cartographers lindberg and alpers who cleverly embedded a fake city agloe into their map agloe ny was not a real town it was a paper town a booby trap to catch plagiarizers a few years after lind berg and alpers set their map trap the fake town appeared on another map by the cartographer rand mcnally prompting the two mapmakers to sue for copy right infringement eventually it was discovered that a real town called agloe had in fact emerged in new york2 since users of the linberg alpers map thought that the agloe that once existed must have gone missing and rebuilt it and that rand mcnally may not have after all have plagiarized lindberg and alpers missing data problem missing data is a big problem for development statis tics it has been reported by jerven that around half of the 82 lowincome countries have had one or par tial poverty surveys within the past decade 21 kai ser fung in his book numbersense 15 discourages the assumption that we have everything and says n all is often an assumption rather than a fact about the data due to missing data problem any ranking of such countries based on gdp only will be mislead ing because of the uneven use of methods and access to data handling missing data is very impor tant for data mining processes as missing observa tions can significantly affect the performance of the model 32 therefore analysts should handle the missing patterns by employing appropriate methods to cope with it and to avoid the streetlight effect the streetlight effect is the trend adopted by researchers to study what is easy to study the street light effect is a major issue that keeps big data find ings from being realistically useful for human development especially when findings are yielded using usergenerated and easily available data some remedies interpretable ai and big data analysis with the wide adoption of deep learning and ensemble

technology and society magazine september 2019to fit the learned hypothesis on unseen data in big data research generalization is the procedure of spanning the characteristics of a group or class to the entire group or population this enables the inference of attri butes of an entire population without getting to know every single element in that population individually the problem comes along when we wrongly generalize or more precisely when we overdo it the generalization fallacy occurs when statistical inferences about a partic ular population are asserted to a group of people for which the original population is not a representative sample in other words models overfit when they learn not only the signal from the training data but also the noise that impedes the models capability to predict on unseen data in order to avoid excessive generalization error researchers should also check the scope of the results instead of extending scientific findings to the whole population regularization is helpful to avoid overfitting by reducing the number of parameters to fit model in highdimensional data 35 it also prevents model parameters to change easily which helps in keeping the focus of the model on the persistent struc ture apart from regularization other techniques such as crossvalidation early stopping weight sharing weight restriction sparsity constraints etc can also be used for reducing the generalization error based on the algorithm being used avoiding bias big data tends to have high dimensionality and may be conflicting subjective redundant and biased the awareness of potential biases can improve the quality of decisions at the level of individuals organizations and communities 25 in a study of 1000 major busi ness investments conducted by mckinsey it was found that when organizations worked to minimize the biases in their decisionmaking they achieved up to 7 higher returns 30 the biases associated with multiple com parisons can be deliberately avoided using techniques such as the bonferroni correction 48 the sidak correc tion and the holmbonferroni correction 1 another source of bias is called data snooping or data dredging which occurs when a portion of data is used more than once for model selection or inference in technical eval uations of results it is conceivable to repeat experi ments using the same dataset to get satisfactory results 49 data dredging can be avoided by conducting ran domized outofsample experiments during hypotheses building for example an analyst gathers a dataset and arbitrarily segments it into two subsets a and b initial ly only one subset say subset a is analyzed for constructing hypotheses once a hypothesis is formulat ed it should then be tested on subset b if subset b also supports such a hypothesis then it might be trust ed as valid similarly we should use such models that can consider the degree of data snooping for obtaining genuinely good results finding causality rather than correlations in most data analysis performed in the big data era the focus is on determining correlations rather than on understanding causality 37 for bd4d problems were more interested in determvining causes rather than cor relates and therefore we must place a premium on per forming causal bd4d analysis since causally driven analysis can improve bd4d decisions discovering caus al relations is difficult and involves substantial effort and requires going beyond mere statistical analysis as pointed out by freedman 14 who has highlighted that for data analytics to be practically useful it should be problemdriven or theory driven not simply datadriven as freedman says using big data for development requires the expenditure of shoe leather to situate the work in the proper context the focus on correlation has arisen because of the lack of a suitable mathematical framework for studying the slippery problem of causality until the recent fundamental progress made by pearl 37 whose work has now provided a suitable notation and algebra for performing a causal analysis stress highquality data analytics rather than big data analytics a better and thoughtful understanding of risks or pitfalls of big data is crucial to decrease its associated poten tial harms to individuals and society there needs to be a stress on utilizing big data along with data collected through traditional sources to provide a deeper clearer understanding of problems instead of being fixated on only generating and analyzing large volumes of data although it is generally preferred to have more data it is not always desirable especially in the cases where data is biased another disadvantage of large datasets is cost in terms of processing storage and maintenance how ever some simple

sources air pollution sources such as agricultural areas fireplaces construction processes in cities heating and cooling units in the buildings are categorized as area sources of urban air pollution the pollutants from area sources result in particulate matter and other criteria pollutants household emissions also contribute to the degradation of air quality processes like biomass combustion fossil fuel burning such as coal diesel kerosene oil etc tobacco smoking and cen tral air conditioning are a few important sources of household emissions household emissions create different criteria and biological pollutants since this paper only considers ambient air pollution indoor air pollution sources are out of the scope of this work we also want to note here that multiple sources from diverse surroundings contribute to urban air pollution which varies depending on the geographical location of the pollution sources in the city wind direction and speed humidity and other meteorological conditions and so on therefore attributing urban air pollution to a single pollution source is an inaccurate approach to look at this issue the relationship between criteria pollutants and their sources is provided in table 4 the table is made based on the information provided by the us epa7and nps8 23 air quality index the air quality index aqi is a metric used for quantifying and communicating the air quality in a particular location aqi suggest the amount of air pollutant in the air over a specific average interval these air pollution concentration values are measured by a sensor or extrapolated from a simulationemulation model the concentration of the pollutant and time window is used to determine the dose of the air pollution and insights from epidemiological research provide its health impacts based on these health impacts a color code and a health advisory are issued for a specific range of the aqi values the air quality information varies for different countries

25concentration went 35 to 40 times higher than the who recommended value and the city officials warned people to stay indoors 52 the guardian describes it as beijings airpocalypse similarly in shanghai the air pollution went beyond the critical level there the recorded pm 25concentration was six times more than the who recommended value given the situation in 2014 the chines government released a national air quality action plan worth 270 billion 9 httpsappcpcbccrcomccr docsfinalreport aqi pdf 10 httpsaqicnorgscaleusd with the sole purpose of bringing the air pollution down the plan has three goals 1 reduce the pm 10by 10 relative to its value in 2012 2 reduce the pm 25by 25 in beijingtianjinhebei by 20 in the pearl river delta and by 15 in the yangtze river delta 3 reduce annual pm 25of beijing to 60 gm3 the national air quality action plan worked for china by 2017 the pm 25concentration in beijingtianjinhebei went down by 36 in pearl and yangtze delta the air pollution went down by 27 and 34 respectively this success was achieved due to a collaborative effort from different government entities in reducing the dependency on coal controlling car emissions increasing renewable energy enforcing emission policies reducing steel and plastic manufacturing and replacing coal boilers with natural gas or electric heaters 53 though these steps have improved the air quality in china the war against air pollution is not over as longterm solutions for bringing air pollution down to the whos recommended values are needed 312 india india is the 2nd most populated

pollution are emitted by the automotive vehicles ten coal power plants around the city are also adding to the particulate pollution by emitting black carbon 58 in 1998 the air quality in sumatra and kalimantan was below the who recommended threshold in the last 20 years the air quality in these cities has gone three times poorer than the recommended value this shift is because of illegal peatland agriculture deforestation and wildfires 58 the indonesian government has taken initial steps in overcoming the air quality issue by adopting the euro 4 fuel enforcing automotive health monitoring policies and developing a peatland restoration agency indonesias coal based energy production has doubled in the last ten years and this is due to the tradeoff between the economy and pollution a lot of collaborative effort is needed to ensure the better air quality in indonesia 314 pakistan pakistan is the fifth most populated country with one of the highest population growth rates 20 on the aqli pollution ranking it is ranked 4th in the most polluted countries pakistan has seen a 20 increase in the pm 25 concentration in the last two decades 59 lahore has the poorest air quality in pakistan where pm25 concentration is six times higher 64 gm3 than the whos recommended value 59 if this level of pollution concentration is sustained an average person in lahore will lose approximately 53 years of life expectancy almost 99 of the total population is exposed to pollution levels higher than the recommended who air pollution values 57 citing this looming threat the pakistani government started enforcing the air pollution regulations for improving urban air quality in 2017 following three initiatives are taken to ensure improvement of the air quality stubble burning is a major contributor to air pollu tion in pakistan the government of punjab banned stubble burning and promoted alternative methods for getting rid of stubble emission regulations were enforced on the vehicles factories and brick kilns for improving the air quality pakistan has also shut down many coalbased power plants for two months this measure has improved the air quality but resulted in many power outages pakistan can improve air quality sustainably by exploiting re newable power sources and continuously enforcing emission regulations 315 bangladesh bangladesh is the 8th most populated country

the deformation in the plume trajectory caused by the mountainous terrain it is capable of simulating the flow anddistortions in the plume near predefined three dimensional 3d terrain features while remaining simple by applying flowdistortion adjustments to flatterrain gaussian and bigaussian pollution distributions 121 122 the ctdmplus requires a significant amount of information on the

photochemical air quality models are often used to evaluate the effectiveness of the control strategies for regulatory anal ysis and attainment demonstrations photochemical models can model the air quality at different spatial scales local regional national global etc photochemical air quality models are also known as photochemical grid models these models are used to evaluate the changes in the concentrations of the criteria pollutants due to the changes in the associated variables meteorological conditions emission sources etc similarly these models are also used for accessing the sensitivity of the pollutant predictions in different use cases photochemical grid models are also used to evaluate the performance of pollution control policies they simulate the concentration of the air pollutants at a large scale by using a complex set of mathematical equations to characterize different atmospheric processes physical and chemical two types of commonly used photochemical air quality models are the lagrangian trajectory model and the eulerian grid model the lagrangian trajectory model uses the moving frame of reference for modeling the air quality whereas the eulerian grid model applies fixed 3d geometric models to the ground to model the air quality of a particular geographical area 1 community multiscale air quality cmaq cmaq modeling system is a stateoftheart pho

so that the chemistry can influence the weather more details on the wrfcmaq are available in 128 cmaqddm cmaq decoupled direct method cmaqddm offers concentrations and deposition sensitivity statistics for user specified parameters 129 the motivation for cmaqddm comes from the desire to mea sure the concentrations of the pollutants by changing one or a few parameters out of many predefined air quality model parameters 130 air quality models usually take emissions as input and predict their concentrations cmaq ddm provides the ability to the policymakers to look at the pollution landscape by tweaking the parameters of interest or emission sources eg wildfires vehicles etc more details on the cmaqddm are available in 129 131 cmaqisam cmaq integrated source ap portionment method cmaqisam is a vari ant of cmaq that measures the attribution of the source in the overall value of the pollutant concentrations predictedoutputted by the air quality models for example identifying the proportion of the smog created by the stubble burning in a neighboring city this can be achieved by running the cmaq twice first with all emission use cases and second by removing the source of interest but this will be complex and computationally expensive cmaqisam this issue by calculating source attribution of many sources directly by the model in one simulation

modeling system that models the particulate haze and other criteria pollutants it is a regional scale modeling system that can simulate the physical and the reactive processes in the environment to show the effects of the spatiotemporal changes in the air pollutant concentration on the overall ambient air quality 4 urban airshed model variable grid uamv in the early 1970s the most commonly used air mod eling system was uamv photochemical modeling system18 uamv was widely used for air quality studies focused on ozone it is a 3d photochemical grid model that can model the effects of the chemical and physical processes in the environment on the concentrations of air pollutants uamv also pro vided a spatiotemporal distribution of the emissions of various air pollutants uamv is outdated and no longer used for air quality modeling 423 receptor modelling the third category of the air quality models is called receptor models these models are mathematical techniques for recognizing and quantifying the origins of air pollution at a particular receptor location 137 receptor models are different from dispersion and photochemical air quality models they do not require meteorological chemical and emission data to estimate the participation of the pollution sources in the air pollution concentrations at the receptor the receptor model uses the chemical and inert properties of gases so 2 co etc and the particulate matter particles to determine to contributions of the emission sources in the pollution concentrations at the receptor 138 139 1 chemical mass balance cmb the cmb 140 is a model for estimating the contribution of the emission sources to air pollution at the receptor locations cmb uses spatial ambient data and information 16 httpswwwcamxcom 17

source contributions cmb quantifies the contributions at the receptor based on the distinct source types rather than individual emission sources a drawback of cmb is its inability to distinguish between emis sion sources with the same chemical and physical properties more details on the cmb are available in 140 2 unmix unmix19model uses a formulabased on a form of factor analysis to determine the chemical species in the air and their sources it does not take the chemical profile of the pollution sources as input instead it generates the chemical profile to estimate the number of pollution sources their syntheses and their participation in the air pollution at the receptor location 3 positive matrix factorization pmf pmf 141 is another air quality model which takes different features from sediments wet deposition surface water ambient air indoor air etc to identify the species of air pollutants pmf also determines the contributions of the pollution sources at the receptor the us epa no longer updates pmf and it no longer supports newer operating systems 43 air quality measuring sensors the air quality sensors are the most crucial component of any air quality monitoring network these sensors are used to determine the concentration of pollutants in the air typically these sensors are built with a lego connection for the data acquisition card and data telemetry is accomplished using wifi or cellular communication in practice data processing is done on the cloud rather than on the sensor however there have been a few situations where data is preprocessed on the air quality sensors specifications of air quality sensors are broadly given by the following parameters 1 accuracy this is a measure of how close the read ings of sensors would be as compared to the actual pollutant value 2 precision this is a measure of how well the sensor reproduces the same reading a sensor with low precision can give different readings at different times with the same pollutant level 3 range and detection limitations this is the mea sure of range of pollutant concentration that the sensor is able to detect correctly sensor performance may vary with different concentration of pollutant 4 copollutant interference cross interference from other pollutants also affect sensor readings it is intended to minimize the copollutant interference when measuring a certain pollutant 5 environmental interference sensor performance may vary under different environmental conditions such as low and high temperature humidity sun light etc 6 noise noise is the source of inaccuracy in sensor readings the effect of noise should be minimized to produce more precise and accurate sensor readings 19httpswwwepagovairresearch unmix60modelenvironmentaldataanalyses7 signal drift this is the drift in readings which occurs due to inherent sensor measurement methods and degradation of sensors components many air quality sensors suffer from signal drift when selecting a sensor it should be ensured that the drift can either be handled or it does not affect the readings to a significant level 8 response time different sensors can produce read ings with different minimum time intervals it should be ensured that the selected sensor is able to produce readings with acceptable time intervals 9 multisite measurement performance this is an in dicator that generalizes the copollutant interference and the environmental interference of sensor 431 measurement techniques a summary of the types of sensors and measurement techniques has been show in figure 4 particulate matter measurement of particulate mat ter concentration is broadly categorized in three methods gravimetric microbalance and optical mea surements whalley et al 142 gravimetric method is widely used by regulatory and certification au thorities it is based on weight difference of a filter medium before and after the gas is passed through the filter microbalance method uses the change in resonant frequency to measure the particulate matter concentration by far the most popular choice for measurement commercial realtime particulate matter sensors is the optical method scattering or absorption of a light beam is measured to determine the concentration of particulate matter gases the two major sensor types used for sensing gaseous pollutants are electrochemical sensor 143 and metal oxide sensors metal oxide sensors typi cally require more power to heat up to very high temperatures to enable significant sensitivity to target detection gas that also increases the start up time of sensor electrochemical sensors require less power to operate and thus allow for fast startup time and cost savings generated over life time of sensor20 432 sensing solutions oem sensors oem

urban air project sought to infer air quality in areas where air quality stations were not available 146 it is a difficult undertaking since accessible air quality data is sparse and limited to tackle this challenge zheng et al 146 gathered context data from a range of additional sources meteorology road networks traffic flow poi and human mobility that have an indirect impact on air quality after acquiring the context data it is fused with sparse aqi data from known locations then spatial and temporal classifiers are used for inferring the aqi values at unknown places the spatial classifier is an artificial neural network ann that takes a subset of data and tries predicting aqi for unknown nodes by using pearson correlation of known features between nodes the temporal classifier takes the timedependent factors and tries predicting aqi for unknown nodes using a linearchain conditional random field crf the training is performed by iteratively adding unknown nodes to the set of known nodes that are classified confidently by the models for inferring aqi value at some unknown locationgrid features are applied to each classifier independently only those aqi values are reported where both classifiers have higher confidence results of the experiment are compared with different interpolation techniques like linear gaussian classical dispersion model decision tree crf and ann the initial step of urban air only inferred pm 10andno 2values for beijing and shanghai in subsequent work zheng et al 147 combined the spatiotemporal model with a realtime feature extraction database to make userfriendly web and mobile applications 512 forecasting air quality at each station following the successful inference of aqi values at arbitrary sites the next phase in the urban air project was to forecast aqi values at specific station locations 148 forecasting aqi values is critical because it allows policymakers to better un derstand air pollution trends and develop preventative and mitigation policies the method of estimating the next aqi value at a certain time granularity based on prior aqi values is known as aqi forecasting various connected aspects such as meteorology wind speeds temperature and so on might have an impact on the forecasting process therefore a realtime database is utilized to give meteorological datahumidity temperature and wind speed as well as weather forecasts and aqi values for each station site the forecasting component of the urban air project gathers data from 2296 stations in 302 chinese cities with each instance having concentrations of six air pollutants no 2so2o3copm 25 andpm 10 zheng et al 148 employed the four predictors listed below to forecast the aqi value at a station a temporal predictor is used to anticipate the aqi value using a linear regression model on the data a spatial predictor is used to provide the surrounding context to a neural network which forecasts an aqi value based on the context data a prediction aggregator trains a regression tree to give various weights to the first two predictions under different scenarios finally an inflection predictor is employed to simulate any rapid changes in aqi values and is only utilized in exceptional cases rain etc for the first 16 hours the aqi value after each hour is predicted while for the next 712h 1324h and 2548h a minmax range of aqi is forecasted zheng et al

solve the sensor placement problem with a restricted budget in the urban air project hsieh et al 74 used a two stage technique to handle this problem the first phase is to infer the air quality at an unknown place and the second is to pick candidate locations depending on the confidence of the inference the city of beijing has split into 1km x 1km patches for inference with each patch referred to as a node by linking these nodes with known and unknown aqi values a network is formed some of the linkages are made with the help of historical geographical and environmental factors local meteorology road network data and pois are used to provide weight to edges once the graph is complete an unknown aqi value is calculated using a weighted sum of aqi values from known modes instead of only obtaining a single value for aqi a distribution is learnt at each unknown node the weights of the graph are modified over numerous rounds to get a better distribution minimize entropy loss for recommending the locations of the station first find the node with the best distribution or lower entropy loss and rank it the last in the list after assigning a rank to this node label it as a known node and again run the inferring algorithm to find new inference after this find the node with the best distribution and assign it second last this step is repeated until all nodes are ranked 514

using the urban infrastructure gathering air quality and related data via these two paradigms is difficult because of the following challenges in static sensorcentric air quality data collection sensors are deployed at a fixed location and they communicate at a predefined frequency to the cen tral database ie cloud server this static sensor deployment makes the air quality measurement a resource constraint system limited budget land use workforce for maintaining the system etc as a result data gathered from very few sensors fixed at different locations in an urban environment is

the air quality sensors for gathering representative enough data becomes a challenge though mobile sensorcentric data collection help resolve the issues faced in air quality data gathering due to the fixed nature of the static sensorcentric approach it has its challenges the air quality data gathered from the sensors mounted on moving objects such as buses bikes taxis uavs etc is skewed by the movement of these moving objects for example buses are usually used as a means of the commute from a busy fixed route the gathered data will provide a good representation of the air quality along the buss route but it will not provide a true depiction of urban air quality another challenge in mobile sensorcentric air quality data is the redundancy in the collected data since the sensorsmounted

deduction made from the distribution will be biased towards the most frequent route human as a sensor is another way of getting the data for inferring the air quality data generated by the citizens

speech technologyespecially those driven by deep learning dl technologyoffer unprece dented opportunities for transforming the healthcare industry in this paper we have focused on the enormous potential of speech technology for revolutionising the healthcare domain more specifically we review the stateoftheart approaches in automatic speech recognition asr speech synthesis or text to speech tts and health detection and monitoring using speech signals we also present a comprehensive overview of various challenges hindering the growth of speechbased services in healthcare to make speechbased healthcare solutions more prevalent we discuss open issues and suggest some possible research directions aimed at fully leveraging the advantages of other technologies for making speechbased healthcare solutions more effective i i ntroduction the current healthcare system is unable to provide universal access to all patients and facing several problems these prob lems include 1 the increasing portion of ageing population which is expected that the number of people aged 65 or older will rise from 524 million in 2010 to 15 billion in 2050 1 2 the increasing burden of chronic diseases which is expected to globally grow from 46 to 57 by 2020 2 3 the lack of human resources ie doctors and nurses and healthcare facilities especially in developing nations1 4 the expensive provision of highquality care 4 and 5 the absence of data driven patientcentred clinical methods due to which people are being assessed on population averages 5 to address these challenges technologybased health can be utilised to provide support to the healthcare system especially speech processing has great potential to provide innovative solutions in healthcare to facilitate both patients and doctors broadly speaking human speech is the most natural mode of human communication it provides information about linguistic content and paralinguistic states and traits the linguistic content represents the intended message that the speaker wishes to convey or communicate paralinguistics content of speech provides a much rich array of information related to speakers identity gender and age research efforts are exploring the intelligent modelling of speech signals for various important applications speech processing research is currently gaining email siddiquelatifusqeduau 1it is anticipated that the world will have a shortage of 129 million healthcare workers by 2035 3interest to utilise computational paralinguistic analysis for the assessment of different health conditions the prime reason to use speech for healthcare is that it can be easily available collected transmitted and stored 6 most importantly various physical and mental diseases cause changes in human speech which are measurable with the help of speech technology speech technology involving the processing and analysis of human speech is a major area of research these days it encompasses various areas of research such as automatic speech recognition asr speaker recognitionverification text to speech tts conversion and identification of language age and gender using speech research on speech technology

designing robust and efficient systems for various applications it usually involves noise suppression silence removal and channel equalisation etc the performance of speechbased systems can be improved with the use of these preprocessing techniques 15 16 it has been also validated that removing silence pauses and noise even helpsmldl models in achieving better performance 17 in the case of speech synthesis text processing is even more complex it involves text normalisation tokenisation sentence segmentation etc 18 it is equally important in speech synthesis to improve system performance b feature extraction the representation of speech signals into meaningful in formative and a reasonably limited number of features is a crucial component for developing any system for speechbased applications despite the fact that there is no unique taxonomy of speech features it is common to divide features into two types ie linguistic and acoustic features the extraction procedures for these two types of features are significantly different and their performance greatly depends upon the type of problem at hand linguistic features represent information in spoken words this usually includes specific words their grammatical al terations or higher semantic and pragmatic markers 19 a variety of techniques exists for the analysis of speech using linguistic features for example keyword spotting aims at the reliable detection of a particular word in a given speech 20 21 these words are chosen from daily life and considered sufficient to represent the speakers states and related events acoustic features are very popular and widely being used these features are primarily extracted using the models of the human auditory system human hearingrelated properties such as lower sensitivity at lower frequencies spectral amplitude compression nonlinear frequency scale and large spectral integration are also considered in acoustic features 22 ongoing research on speech analysis has categorised the acoustic features into three categories prosodic spectral and temporal and features related to the voice quality 23 24 prosody refers to melody and rhythm of speech and prosodic features include the feature related to the length tone accent stress intonation and few others 25 26 these features can be used to detect the irregularities in the rhythm and timing of speech for instance nonverbal speech cues such as interruptions natural turns counting the number of interjections and response times can help to identify irregular speech patterns 27 in contrast to temporal features spectral features are authorized licensed use limited to university of exeter downloaded on july 172020 at 125610 utc from ieee xplore restrictions apply c 2020 ieee personal use is permitted

transformations with the ability to learn intermediate representations suitable for a given task at hand in 2006 an idea of the learning hierarchy of feature representations in different layers of the

layerbylayer pretraining which is followed by finetuning of the entire network using backpropagation these models were widely utilised in speech technology and still being considered for speech

speech and able to capture more generalised discriminative and contextual representation from raw waveform 33 convolutional neural networks cnns were originated from image processing for processing data in gridlike topology they are also extended for natural language processing nlp and speech processing the building block of cnns is a convolutional layer that consists of multiple filters and it computes local feature maps from the input the convolutionaloperation in cnns can be defined as hkij wk q bk 1 where hkijis the ijthelement for the kthoutput feature mapqrepresents the input feature maps and wkandbk denote thekthfilter and bias respectively the symbol represents the 2d convolution operation the second component of cnns is the pooling layer to facilitates nonlinear sub sampling operations is to reduce the dimension of each feature maps while retaining the most important features finally fully connected layers are used to achieve the required prediction for regression or

suffering and highly prevalent in patients with a chronic disease like cancer 77 despite the fact that psychological disorders can cause serious consequences routine screening has not been widely adopted in healthcare due to heavy cost and time requirements 78 recent studies have shown the promise of using speech as an effective biomarker for the diagnosis of psychological disorders spoken speech can provide a wide range of acoustic features that can be effectively utilised for human emotion detection 53 79 and diagnosis and monitoring of depression anxiety stress distress and suicidal behaviour 76 stateof theart deep learning models have improved the performance of emotion recognition depression anxiety stress distress and suicidal behaviour detection using speech 80 81 particularly the combination of cnns and lstm has shown great performance in modelling affective behaviours and related disorders from speech 82 83 here cnn is mainly used to extract temporal features and contextual modelling is performed using lstm cnns are also being employed in an endto end fashion to extract features from raw speech related to the problem at hand eg depression detection 84 convolutional layer in cnns acts a datadriven filterbank that can produce more generalised features compared to the standard artificial neural networks anns and other featurebased approaches 33 in this way deep learning models are playing an importantrole in modelling as well as diagnosis of different psychological disorder using speech signal this demonstrates that the speech technology has great potentials to automate the screening and monitoring of mental illnesses and related disorders hence alleviating many healthcare challenges d home and elder care life expectancy is greatly increasing worldwide which is causing a higher number of older people in our society 5 the increased share of the elderly population is shifting the cause of death from parasitic and infectious diseases to chronic illnesses 85 86 ageing also causes physical limitations that need to be compensated by the assistance of someone or with the services of aged care centres elderly people feel isolation fear and a sense of helplessness both inhome and at oldage care centres which cause severe consequences on both physical and mental health speechbased assistants are a valuable tool for seniors staying at home or age care centres especially for those who are not able to use other technologybased services that may require the dexterity of the hands mobility andor good vision such systems can also provide them with independence and a better quality of life with physical or cognitive disease 76 eaccess to healthcare services particularly in developing countries millions of

have poor literacy skills ie reading writing it has been shown that people with low health literacy have a onein three chance of misunderstanding the prescribed medication 87 there is a direct correlation between mortality rates and poor health literacy approximately 50 to 80 increased mortality risk for individuals with poor health literacy 88 language diversity is another challenge in developing countries that reduces the potential benefits of healthcare services such as text messaging and ehealth portals 89 such healthcare services are also not much useful for lowliterates the blind the visually impaired and those that are not computer literate speech is a plausible interaction modality for illiterate users and speechbased healthcare services can be ideal for inhabitants of the developing countries iv s peech for healthcare state oftheart a automatic speechrecognition asr automatic speech recognition asr is the analogue of machine ear which enables a computer to recognise uttered speech and transform it into the corresponding sequence of words or subwords asr has witnessed a steady improvement in performance due to the development of cuttingedge ml algorithms traditionally hmm and gmm based models were the main stock of research for asr dnnbased asr systems have become the stateoftheart by showing huge improvements compared to previous conventional system 90 developing and training asr systems however is complicated and requires a lot of preprocessing various attempts have been made to reduce the complexity of asr paving the way for endtoend speech recognition 91 nowadays endto end asr systems are extensively used and studied for asr in different languages such as english mandarin japanese or french 92 similarly sequencetosequence models are also gaining popularity in the automatic speech recognition asr community 91 various sequencetosequence models including recurrent neural network transducer rnnt 93 neural transducer 94 listen attend and spell las 95 recurrent neural aligner rna 96 and monotonic alignments 97 have been explored in the literature in addition transformers 98 based models are also gaining success in asr field due to their better performance we presented the performance comparison of different stateof theart models in terms of worderrorrate wer in table ii these systems demonstrate promising results on different datasets which shows the feasibility of their integration into healthcare applications a major application of asr in healthcare is to facilitate the generation of clinical documentations 9 the medical errors caused by bad handwriting can be avoided using speech recognition for medical documentations 108 such selftyping systems are also believed to enhance documentation quality and efficiency as well as improve the satisfaction level of health professionals in clinics or hospitals 71 different research studies explored the feasibility of asr systems for clinical documentation for instance in 109 authors evaluated a webbased asr system in a university hospital for clinical documentation in the german language they found that medical documentation with asr increasesin documentation speed and amount and it also has a positive impact on participant mood in contrast to selftyping hodgson et al 110 explored the use of asr for medical transcription of the doctorpatient conversation they used 14000 hours of speech and demonstrated that the proposed models achieved promising results on important medical utterances and therefore can be used practically in a clinical setting for transcribing medical conversations in 111 authors performed a case study in a specialised outpatient department and found that asr software supports medical doctors by quickly producing patient discharge letters without impairing user satisfaction the efficiency of speech recognition is evaluated by hoyt et al 112 for documenting outpatient encounters in the ehr system at a military hospital and its 12 outlying clinics seventy five clinicians participated to evaluate speech recognition for clinical documentation among these participants 69 of the clinicians continued to use speech recognition in their routine practices and reported that speech recognition for clinical documentation is more convenient accurate and expeditious for instance speech recognition helped in improving note quality and allowed for closing a patient encounter on the same day similarly authors in 113 showed that medical speech recognition can perform on a par with humans authors in 114 developed a webbased prototype to generate medical reports in the brazilian portuguese language using google web speech api and microsoft bing speech api they found that a system based on google api achieved an error rate of 1230 which was significantly better than those achieved by the microsoft api 1768 few other studies 115118 also highlighted the potential of using asr for clinical documentation all of these studies highlight several benefits of using asr for clinical documentation however most of these studies are pilot projects although the use of asr can drive interactive clinical documentation however careful evaluation is required for ehr 119 there is still a need to improve the efficiency of asr for medical documentation to avoid errors that have the potential to cause clinical harms furthermore improved system interoperability and workflow are needed for their successful integration in the clinical setting 120 b speech biomarkers human voice incorporates features that can plausibly be used to discriminate on the basis of gender age intelligence socioeconomic status regionalethnic origin education and occupation 14 most importantly for health outcomes it provides information about various voice disorders which can be diagnosed by detecting anomalous voice quality pitch and loudness that is inappropriate for an individuals age gender cultural background or geographic location 121 other speech related disorders include cognitivecommunication disorders communication disorders swallowing disorders and an autism spectrum disorder speech technologybased solutions have been playing an important role in the diagnostic and monitoring of these disorders nowadays dl models have become the stateoftheart technique in this domain automatic detection of vocal fold pathologies is of great interest to the voice community as well as the medical community due to its low cost and noninvasive nature these systems can be used by clinicians to detect the existence

common clinical voice disorders and evaluated both ml models and dnns they found that dnns outperformed other ml models including svm and gmms authors in 123 used convolutional dbn for voice pathology and showed that cnn can effectively extract features from spectrograms of voice recordings suitable for diagnosing of voice disorders harar et al 124 conducted a preliminary study on voice pathology using dnns and showed that the use of combined cnnlstm provides promising results in 125 the authors investigated a voice pathology detection system using dl on a mobile multimedia healthcare system and voices samples captured using mobile devices more specifically the authors used a cnn architecture and reported significantly improved results in other work some researchers 126 127 designed voice pathology detection systems for smart cities but their work used classical ml models in their architectures acoustic analysis of speech is also used for the diagnosis of alzheimers disease which is cognitive impairment and the most common cause of dementia it has a high prevalence that is increasing rapidly towards an epidemic level the research community is trying to utilise speech technology to solve this issue in 128 lopezdeipina et al proposed a nonlinear multitask approach using a multilayer perceptron mlp and cnns for alzheimers detection the authors evaluated the proposed models using different speech features and reported promising results in 129 fraser et al explored the use of linguistic features for the identification of alzheimers they achieved stateoftheart results and found that linguistic analysis using modern ml is increasingly useful in assessment and clustering of alzheimers speech analysis is also being utilised for parkinsons disease pd detection for instance authors in 130 designed to diagnosis pd using speech signal they used dbns for classi fication and achieved significantly improved results attesting the power of dbn for speech analysis frid et al 131 used raw speech for pd detection using cnns they found that relatively small 20ms of raw speech contains much information regarding the pd that can be used for classification speech technology is also being used for the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder asd in children different studies used dl and speech signals for asd detection 132 133 also to assist children with asd 134 human speech

compared to all other features in 136 the authors showed that the prosody and voice qualityrelated speech features can be used for the identification of suicidal and nonsuicidal adolescents in 137 behaviour prediction of cancerafflicted patients is performed using different speech features they showed that speech can effectively be utilised for behavioural prediction in cancer patients various other studies 138140 utilised speech feature for identification stress anxiety and depression in english and also in other languages most of the abovementioned studies have used publicly available datasets and showed that speech technology can be effectively utilised as biomarkers for the detection of various diseases however these systems have not been evaluated in reallife settings it is important for researchers to focus on the design of systems that can be utilised in clinics and medical hospitals and on reporting reallife performance evaluations c remote monitoring the rising burden on the global healthcare system along with the limited availability of trained healthcare professionals is increasing the demand for infrastructure and technology that can facilitate the remote monitoring of patients speech technology based remote monitoring services have been explored in this regard by the research community in 141 hossain used speech along with and facial expressions which are captured in a multisensory environment the author tested the proposed framework on 100 people and was able to detect the patients state with an average recognition of 982 in another work vatanparvar et al 142 designed a speech privacy preservation method for speechbased remote health monitoring using gan and reported promising results a remote system for monitoring of speechlanguage intervention is proposed in 143 for the parents of children with asd for remote monitoring and assessment of cognitive function in senior people a system was proposed by rapcan et al in 144 the authors used telephone speech recordings and showed that the system can achieve similar results compared to speech recorded in a controlled environment the sweethome project was proposed in 145 which used noiserobust multisource asr to detect distressed sentences in a realistic environment of a smart home to monitor distress situations various studies also have proposed speech remote monitoring systems by exploiting the advanced communication technolo gies a 5g enabled emotionaware healthcare framework was proposed in 146 the authors evaluated the proposed healthcare framework on 50

asked to express the emotion of pain they used both speech and video as the input of the system and achieved 9995 of accuracy a privacyenhanced emotion recognition system for remote advisory is presented in 147 the authors showed that the proposed system can solve privacy issues while achieving promising results similarly an edgecloud based privacypreserving automatic emotion recognition system is proposed which use both speech and visual features 148 they used cnns for emotion classification and achieved improved results compared to the stateoftheart systems some other studies 149151 have also used speech signal for remote patients monitoring however most of these studies evaluated the proposed models in a controlled setup therefore to ensure a safe and robust operation it is very important to evaluate these systems in reallife settings d speech synthesis speech synthesis also known as texttospeech tts is an important technology that aims to convert text into speech most of the tts systems use acoustic or linguistic features as an intermediate representation to generate the waveform traditionally the speech waveform was vocoded from these intermediate representation using heuristic methods 152 or using handcrafted vocoders 153 154 recently tacotron 2 155 used wavenet 57 as a vocoder to generate waveform from melspectrograms wavenet is an autoregressive gener ative model that can generate relatively realistic humanlike speech by using linguistic features it has the downside of a long inference time due to its autoregressive architecture to address this issue various models such as fftnet 156 wavernn 157 and waveglow 158 have been proposed nowadays these neural vocoders have replaced the use of traditional heuristic methods and can dramatically enhance the quality of generated speech researchers are also focusing on synthesising more natural speech by transferring prosody 159 style 160 and expressions 161 all these studies have highlighted the great progress made by tts systems that shows their suitability in healthcare we also compared the performance in terms of mean opinion score mos of different stateoftheart tts systems in table iii which

of bettering patient care through the use of assistive and digital tools it can further enhance digital health technology by speechbased health apps websites and emergency call systems etc patients can be verbally reminded about important alerts using tts which increases the usability and accessibility of portable health trackers 167 different studies evaluated the feasibility of tts assistive healthcare system for instanceliu et al 168 designed a smartphonebased system to help visually impaired people while using android phones in 169 the authors presented a design of a ttsbased interactive medication reminder and tracking system for wrist devices they evaluated the system for both native and nonnative english speakers in controlled experiments and achieved very promising results a voice interactive assistant was designed in 170 to improve adherence to medical treatments the authors designed this system for stroke patients and tested among several healthy subjects for an initial assessment however the final product was reported to be still under development tts health assistive tools can dramatically improve people health and required costs for example a ttsbased system can facilitate patients by offering them an audio version of digital text 171 172 this is especially helpful for illiterate individuals language learners and the elderly population and people with learning disabilities or reduced vision such systems can also help people by providing an audio version of important medical information such as descriptions of diseases prescriptions and drug information leaflets this avoids drug misuse while making patients cautious about their health 173 ttsbased systems also allow patients to accurately communicate their needs which helps to establish a cognitive connection among doctors and patients 174 e some healthcare solution using speech technology as outlined above speech technology finds its market in healthcare particularly due to potential and impactful use cases various voiceenabled healthcare solutions are developed that can help improve the lives of thousands of individuals we presented the details of some prominent solutions in table iv these solutions are being used by both doctors and patients to change the traditional setting of health provision the development of speechbased solutions is continuously growing that will significantly impact the current healthcare system in the next several years v s peech forhealthcare challenges despite the promising potentials of speech technology in the health domain there are various hurdles in largescale deployment of speechenabled solutions in this section we discuss these challenges that need to be addressed to make the rapid adoption of speech technology in healthcare a taxonomy is depicted in figure 5 a speech based adversarial attacks even though modern dlbased speech solutions offer great benefits to the current healthcare system there are still questions about the security of the underlying dl algorithms as recent works have shown that dl models are prone to adversar ial attacks adversarial attacks are launched by creating adversarial examples in which nonrandom imperceptible perturbations are added to input samples through optimization algorithms that aim to fool the classifier and influence it to make incorrect decisions these attacks are powerful enough to significantly bring down the performance of the stateoftheart dnn based systems 194 a popular method for generating such adversarial attacks is to generate the perturbation by utilizing gradientbased methodsmany popular attacks such as fast gradient sign method fgsm 195 jacobianbased saliency map attack jsma 196 deepfool 197 and carlini authorized licensed use limited to university

health is not only a technological but cultural transformation cultural barrier is a major challenge for digital transformation which becomes more prevalent in rural and developing areas the transformation of people from the classical method to digital health is slowed down by ignoring the importance of cultural changes and the human factors 210 therefore it is impor tant to consider cultural barriers while designing healthcare solutions in addition to cultural barriers language diversity problem is another major problem it is found that the linguistic differences among patients and medical doctors can cause patients to misinterpret medications and suffer unnecessary complications 86 therefore healthcare solutions based speech technology must be trained on multiple languages to work effectively in such situations however the development of speech technologybased healthcare systems becomes more challenging for rarely spoken languages therefore it is very important to consider language diversity while designing speechbased healthcare solutions vi o pen issues and future directions speech technology is expected to drive the change in the healthcare system by changing the conventional ways of medical treatments however there are some open issues that require serious attention and consideration of the researchers therefore in this section we highlighted such open issues and with important pointers and future research directions for the research community a privacy and ethical concerns when people use speechbased services such as speech recognition or voice authentication they provide complete possession to their voice recordings to the respective device or software in these services speech can be used by an adversary or attacker to extract users information such as speakers identity gender ethnicity information and emotional state the adversary can use this information for undesired purposes such as to fool voiceauthentication systems similarly users speech can also be edited or used to create a fake speech that the person never spoke several other privacy related concerns arise while using speech technologybased services 211 in healthcare systems information is more personal and very sensitive and people are more vulnerable to the misuse of their data therefore it is important to utilise speech processing in healthcare by considering both privacy and ethical concerns in this regard privacypreserving dl algorithms can be utilised to protect speaker identity 212 213 gender identity 214 similarly federated learning 215 is another alternative solution to preserve users privacy in federated learning training data remains decentralised using multiple participating devices b adoptability and affordability issues

new valueadded services and the availability of large datasets is a key contributor to these developments 3435 in the networking context spatiotemporal mobile traffic is arguably a highly valuable form of data it consists of information about the timevarying traffic load observed at all locations in a target geographical region a data sample is illustrated in figure 1 plot a shows the time averaged spatial distribution of mobile traffic across a city whereas plot c portrays the space averaged temporal fluctuations of the same traffic over one week additional time series in plot c highlight the diversity of traffic volumes and patterns at different locations information on cityscale mobile traffic has numerous appli cations within and beyond networking prominent examples of

monitoring 52 beyond networking usages for spa tiotemporal mobile traffic emerge eg in urban sensing and com puting 185185 inference of commuting patterns and segrega tion monitoring of demographic patterns detection of land use and its dynamics 33 transporta tion engineering and urban planning 58 or road traffic surveil lance 39 59 limited access to mobile traffic data all aforementioned ap plications are enabled by mobile traffic data that is inherently de personalized as shown in figure 1 the data is aggregated over space eg across all users associated to a same base station or within a same spatial area and time eg during intervals of minutes to hours although its nature poses reduced privacy risks eg as corroborated by the european unions general data protection regulation spatiotemporal mobile traffic data is deemed sensitive by network operators in terms of industrial and commercial se crecy hence access to this data is not uniform and generally scant in the research community and often occurs behind restrictive non disclosure agreements ndas the result is that the potential of mobile traffic data to feed innovation is curbed and current research based on mobile traffic is not reproducible or verifiable synthesis as a solution to data access motivated by the above and to overcome the mobile traffic data access barrier we aim at generating dependable synthetic cityscale spatiotemporal mobile traffic data our goal is to design a model trained on a limited amount of realworld measurement data which can then be used to generate large amounts of highfidelity synthetic traffic from publicly available data about arbitrary geographical regions such a model primarily benefits researchers but also data holders such as network operators by using the trained model researchersconext 21 december virtual event germany kai xu et al would be finally able to independently generate dependable mobile traffic data to support their studies ideally this could lead to the adoption of a reference ensemble of synthetic datasets of spatiotem poral mobile traffic by the community ensuring the comparability of results across works based on such type of data in addition data holders can leverage the model to synthesize and share realistic mo bile traffic data from their measurements with third parties without concerns on leakage of commercially sensitive information challenges of mobile traffic generation however meeting the goal above entails a number of significant and unique challenges firstly generation requires synthesizing spatiotemporal data like that in figure 1 without prior knowledge of the historical traffic in the target area it is thus a different and more complex problem than eg mobile traffic prediction secondly ours is a controllable generation problem the model is required to capture nontrivial correlations between the urban context and the corresponding mo bile traffic so as to generate traffic for a previously unseen urban region solely based on its local contextual conditions thirdly as cities have diverse geographical span the model should be capable of generating traffic over arbitrary spatial dimensions fourthly mobile traffic information must cover long time periods to be useful in many applications therefore the model should allow generating traffic time series of any specified and potentially long duration without compromising dependability meeting these last two re quirements entails capturing complex spatiotemporal dynamics seen in realworld mobile traffic 476465 so as to preserve eg traffic peaks and flows across space and time that are rooted in mobile user movements and digital usages our contributions to attain the goal outlined above and ad dress the associated challenges we propose spectragan a novel generative model based on a tailored deep neural network architec ture in essence spectragan is a conditional neural sampler with two main components an encoder and a generator the role of the encoder is to transform contextual information that is readily avail able via public repositories broadly falling into three categories ie census land use and points of interest pois so that it can be used to control of the generation process an example of context used by our approach is the inhabitant density from population census portrayed in figure 1b for the same city of figure

approach is best explained by means of an example illustrated in figure 1 which refers to the mobile traffic observed over one week in a represen tative city from our dataset the temporal patterns in the mobile network traffic in figure 1c stand out because of the regularity in the underlying network usage reflecting weekdayweekend di chotomies circadian rhythms and routines at work commuting or other daily activities such periodicities make a frequencydomain representation via fourier transformation a compact yet effective way to capture the usagedependent temporal dynamics indeed figure 1d which shows the traffic timeseries data from each pixel in all cities of our dataset in the frequency domain highlights how only a few frequency components appear to be significant across the whole dataset consistent with observations in prior work eg 215272 the effectiveness of a spectrum based design is further proven by figure 1e which portrays the mean traffic reconstructed from the 5 significant frequency components the overlap with the original traffic confirms that the time variation in traffic can be well ap proximated by considering the significant frequency components the residual traffic in figure 1f shows the small part of difference between original and generated traffic which is separately modeled inspectragan in the time domain in the light of these considerations a neural sampler that outputs frequency components can be expected to be especially effective at modeling mobile traffic dynamics moreover there are two impor tant additional advantages with a spectrum based generation first the approach lends itself to learning relation between context and traffic data on a perpixel basis this allows capturing the differencesin significance of various frequency components at the pixel level shown in orange in figure 1d second decomposing traffic into periodic and nonperiodic parts and modeling the former in the frequency domain and the latter in the temporal domain allows overcoming the limitations of rnns mentioned earlier in 211 indeed a spectrum representation naturally adds patterns with identical periodicity in the same bin and enables a

we first obtain the empirical marginal distributions of traffic volume across all locations pixels and time steps for both real and synthetic data then the metric is calculated as the total variation tv distance 6 between the two marginal distributions lower the value of this metric better is the match between real and synthetic data ssim on average traffic ssim ssim 78 is a standard image fidelity metric which compares two images as a function of their respective mean and variance across pixels as well as covariance between the images ssim lies between 0 and 1 closer to the latter is desirable we use this metric to quantify the spatial fidelity of the generated data by a model and compute it using the timeaveraged traffic maps for real and synthetic data autocorrelation by 1ac1 this metric also considered in previous work 46 is aimed at quantifying the temporal fidelity of the synthetic data with respect to the real data we compute it by taking the 1norm between the corresponding points of the autocorrelations of real and synthetic timeseries data at the pixel level lower values imply better performance as per this metric trainsynthetictestreal tstr this metric aims to capture the quality of generated data through the lens of a generic down stream use case as done in previous works 30 we use synthesized citywide traffic timeseries to train a linear regression model to predict city traffic snapshot for a future timestep the performance of the trained model is then evaluated on real data in terms of 2 frechet video distance fvd 69 this metric originally de signed for video data aims at evaluating the quality of spatiotempo ral data generation by treating cityscale mobile traffic over time as video data we obtain embeddings of real and synthetic videos and then compute the frechet distance between these embeddings lower this distance better the quality in the video generation set ting the embeddings are obtained via a pretrained neural network however using a neural network in our case entails a risk to intro duce a bias that may artificially favor our model instead we devise a strategy tailored to our spatiotemporal mobile traffic generation setting specifically we first spatially flatten the spatiotemporal traffic data into a multivariate timeseries we then use a signature transformation 1553 to convert the multivariate timeseries into a vector which we use as the embedding and employ vectors of the real and synthetic traffic data to compute fvd 33 baselines to evaluate spectragan we consider the following baselines that represent the stateoftheart on mobile traffic generation as well as generic spatial temporal and spatiotemporal data generation fit distribution and sample fdas as later discussed in 7 the current stateoftheart on mobile traffic generation essentially involve fitting an empirical distribution to model the traffic data using maximum likelihood estimation of parameters and then sam ple it afterwards to generate synthetic data while previous works focus on just the peak hour 26 or peak and offpeak hours 54 a weekly traffic generated with fdas forcity a averaged

evaluation approach essentially we choose one city as a test city each time and train each model spectragan and baselines with traffic and associ ated context data for the remaining cities and repeat this process with a different test city for all cities we conduct this evaluation separately for country 1 dataset with 9 cities and country 2 dataset with 4 cities this not only allows us to study the relative fidelity of different models with respect to the metrics described in 32 but also lets us assess the generalization ability of different models to synthesizing mobile traffic for unseen cities this testing approach is also well aligned with the intended use of spectragan to generate traffic data for new regions solely from publicly avail able context for those regions finally it is worth recalling that the considered cities have various sizes ranging from 3333to5048 pixels therefore the leaveonecityout strategy allows assessing the capability of the model to generate traffic for arbitrarily sized areas since the dimension of the training cities and test city may not be the same unless otherwise specified in the following the traffic data is generated at an hourly granularity to be consistent across all the methods compared but we remark that spectragan is by de sign potentially capable of generating more granular traffic data if equivalently accurate data is available for

that the fdas method relies on sampling empirically fitted traffic data distributions at every time step figure 6a shows citywide average temporal traffic pattern generated by fdas forcity aas test city data generated for two representative pixels reflecting the maximum and median traffic pixels in the ground truth are also shown the corresponding real timeseries traffic pattern is shown in figure 1c the fdas gen erated data fails to preserve the diurnal pattern seen in the real data it is also unable to capture the absolute differences in traffic volumes across different locations we can make the same observation about spatial traffic patterns with fdas the timeaveraged traffic maps for city ccity d andcity hgenerated with fdas are respectively shown in fig ures 6b 6c 6d which are in stark contrast to the corresponding real traffic maps shown in figure 7 in the row labeled data the seemingly random traffic timeseries and maps generated by fdas can be attributed to the inherent limitation with this approach to treat spatial locations and time steps independently thus unable to capture strong correlations that exist across these dimensions while we find that fdas can capture the overall citywide traffic data distributions well as reflected by its m tvresults not showntable 2 average testing performance in country 1 method m tvssimac1tstrfvd spectragan 00362 205 pix2pix

observed between models informed with realworld or spectragan generated traffic in all three use cases above in other words evaluations of the methods based on spectra gan generated data are as dependable as similar assessments with actual measurement data this proves our point that researchers could use synthetic data generated by our model to demonstrate the performance of the solutions considered in sections 5153 in a way that is both credible due to the similar performance just mentioned and reproducible as synthetic data can be more easily shared than realworld data these results pave the way for fur ther studies considering additional application use cases towards a complete assessment of the suitability of spectragan as a tool for the creation of dependable reference spatiotemporal mobile traffic datasets for the research community 6 discussion as the first model of its kind spectragan has limitations that we deem important to discuss so as to also foster further studies towards open data synthesis for networking research first there is no universal spatiotemporal granularity of the mobile traffic data that is relevant and appropriate for all down stream applications some studies have indicated that analyses of several digital human activities are adequately supported by data with a spatiotemporal resolution of 2 km 22 and 30 min utes 37 which is largely satisfied in our case also many previous works eg have designed and evaluated solutions based on mobile network traffic using datasets with resolutions of 235235 square meters in space and 10 minutes in time which are comparable to granularity of real and synthetic data in our work examples such as those above or in section 5 show that spectragan data can support studies on such concrete use cases however the suitability of spectragan data for additional applica tions needs to be assessed case by case and remains a shortcoming of our study and in the literature in general a setting where the synthetic data currently generated by spec tragan would clearly be illsuited is for studies requiring a higherconext 21 december virtual event germany kai xu et al table 8 fidelity of

presently have groundtruth data that can be used to verify this hypothesis as another limitation we would like to clarify that it is not the purpose of spectragan to model the deeper causes that under pin the spatiotemporal fluctuations of mobile network traffic such as the activity or mobility of the users while these phenomena obviously play a big role in determining the spatial and temporal dynamics of mobile traffic in the network explicitly including them in the generative process is not needed to attain our data synthesis objective indeed the spectragan deep neural network architec ture learns a complex function that translates static context into realistic spatiotemporal traffic by abstracting various causal pro cesses in a nonobservable way therefore if the explicit generation of the underlying user activity or mobility is required our model is not an appropriate tool 7 related work network traffic modeling has received substantial attention in the literature but largely focused on packet level traffic generation via packet sizes interpacket arrival times number of traffic gener ation tools exist for this purpose eg iperf 8 ditg 16 os tinato 5 and such traffic generation capability is embedded in network simulators like ns3 2 and omnet 3 some of these tools merely focus on the capability to generate arbitrary packet level workloads with no constraint on

generation for network intrusion detection type applications see 50 for a good survey and for social network traffic generation based on session durations intersession times etc 14 our focus is on spatiotemporal mobile network traffic generation which is an entirely different problem from the ones above closest works from the literature to ours by domain are di francesco et al 26 oliveira et al 54 which consider the synthesis of mobile network traffic at macroscopic ie urban scales the approach in di francesco et al 26 requires information on bs locations and on the distribution of traffic on a peruser basis which are typically very difficult to obtain and the latter also poses privacy concerns even so the essence of synthetic mobile traffic generation in di francesco et al 26 and also that in oliveira et al 54 can be described as fitting the traffic statistics to an empirical probability distribution and then sampling from it broadly similar to that from earlier works in the general networking context eg vishwanath and vahdat 71 we consider this approach in our evaluations and show that it fails to capture traffic correlations in space and time as also acknowledged in di francesco et al 26 unlike theseprior works our spectragan is a conditional deep generative model that is designed to account for these correlations only needs publicly available contextual data to generate traffic in previously unseen urban regions and is validated extensively with realworld mobile traffic measurement datasets more recently lin et al 46 with a similar overall motivation to ours have proposed doppelganger a conditional deep generative model aimed at network timeseries data which relies on batched rnn for capturing longterm temporal correlations in data as doppelganger does not have a spatial dimension applying it our cityscale spatiotemporal mobile network traffic data generation leads to treating each spatial location independently as a result doppelganger is unable to capture spatial and spatiotemporal correlations well as we demonstrate in our evaluations beyond the networking domain neural networks have been extensively used for modeling spatiotemporal data

forecasting 458184 or learning spatiotemporal feature representations for prediction problems 63 while these meth ods share a similar highlevel goal we target they are not well suited for mobile network traffic generation reasons include that such previous approaches are limited to the estimation of a few future frames 74 are conditioned on previous frames 61 cap ture only shortterm temporal correlations 447576 and can be only conditioned on nonspatial contexts such as weather or weekdaysweekends 458184 in contrast spectragan is de signed to model spatiotemporal relations over long periods of time and to condition the generated data on spatial contexts we also show through our evaluations that a representative model from this body of literature is not effective for our traffic generation task highlighting the need for domain appropriate data generation methods like spectragan 8 conclusions we have presented spectragan a new conditional gan model spectragan is the first synthetic generation method for cityscale spatiotemporal mobile network traffic data it embeds a number of innovative aspects including the defining approach to generate the significant frequency components of the traffic spectrum for each spatial location based on local contextual attributes importantly thespectragan generation process is conditioned on context data that is typically publicly available for a city of interest so as to fos ter its usability we evaluate spectragan using multicity mobile traffic datasets for two european countries augmented with con textual data for each city our results show that spectragan not only significantly outperforms existing approaches that could be used for spatiotemporal data generation but is also able to generate highfidelity longterm mobile traffic data for completely unseen cities solely based on contextual input we also demonstrate the efficacy of spectragan through multiple application use cases in mobile networking and

to provide an overview of applications of unsupervised learning in the domain of networking we provide a comprehensive survey highlighting recent advancements in unsupervised learning techniques and

ml will also make a similar impact on the networking ecosystem and will help realize a future vision of cognitive networks 1 2 in which networks will selforganize and will autonomously implement intelligent networkwide behavior to solve problems such as routing scheduling resource allocation and anomaly detection the initial attempts towards creating cognitive or intelligent networks have relied mostly on supervised ml methods which are ef cient and powerful but are limited in scope by their need for labeled data with network data becom ing increasingly voluminous with a disproportionate rise in unstructured unlabeled data there is a groundswell of interest in leveraging unsupervised ml methods to utilize unlabeled data in addition to labeled data where available to optimize network performance 3 the rising interest in applying unsupervised ml in networking applications also stems from the need to liberate ml applications from restric tive demands of supervised ml another reason of employing unsupervised ml in networking is the expensiveness of curating labeled network data at scale since labeled data may be unavailable and manual annotation is prohibitively inconvenient in addition to be outdated quickly due to the highly dynamic nature of computer networks 4 we are already witnessing the failure of human network administrators to manage and monitor all bits and pieces of network 5 and the problem will only exacerbate with further growth in the size of networks with paradigms such as becoming the internet of things iot an mlbased network management system nms is desirable in such large net works so that faultsbottlenecksanomalies may be predicted in advance with reasonable accuracy in this regard networks already have ample amount of untapped data which can pro vide us with decisionmaking insights making networks more ef cient and selfadapting with unsupervised ml the pipe dream is that every algorithm for adjusting network parame ters be it tcp congestion window or rerouting network traf c during peak time will optimize itself in a selforganizing fashion according to the environment and application user and network quality of service qos requirements and constraints 6 unsupervised ml methods in concert with existing supervised ml methods can provide a more ef cient method that lets a network manage monitor and optimize itself while keeping the human administrators in the loop with the provisioning of timely actionable information next generation networks are expected to be selfdriven which means they have the ability to selfcon gure optimize and heal 7 all these selfdriven properties can be achieved by building arti cial intelligence in the system using ml techniques selfdriven networks are supposed to utilize the network data to perform networking chores and most of the network data is imbalanced and unlabeled in order to develop a reliable datadriven network data quality must be taken care before subjecting it to an appropriate unsupervisedml 8 unsupervised ml techniques facilitate the analy sis of raw datasets thereby helping in generating analytic insights from unlabeled data recent advances in hierarchical learning clustering algorithms factor analysis latent models and outlier detection have helped signi cantly advance the state of the art in unsupervised ml techniques in particular recent unsupervised ml advancessuch as the development of deep learning techniques 22have however signif icantly advanced the ml state of the art by facilitating the processing of raw data without requiring careful engineering and domain expertise for feature crafting deep learning is a class of machine learning where hierarchical architectures are used for unsupervised feature learning and these learned features are then used for classi cation and other related tasks 23 the versatility of deep learning and distributed ml can be seen in the diversity of their applications that range from selfdriving cars to the reconstruction of brain circuits 22 unsupervised learning is also often used in conjunction with supervised learning in semisupervised learning setting to preprocess the data before analysis and thereby help in crafting a good feature representation and in nding patterns and structures in unlabeled data the rapid advances in deep neural networks the democ ratization of enormous computing capabilities through cloud computing and distributed computing and the ability to store and process large swathes of data have motivated a surging interest in applying unsupervised ml techniques in the net working eld the eld of networking also appears to be well suited to and amenable to applications of unsupervised ml techniques due to the largely distributed decisionmaking nature of its protocols the availability of large amounts of network data and the urgent need for intelligentcognitive networking consider the case of routing in networks net works these days have evolved to be very complex and they incorporate multiple physical paths for redundancy and utilize complex routing methodologies to direct the traf c the application traf c does not always take the optimal path we would expect leading to unexpected and inef cient routing performance to tame such complexity unsupervised ml techniques can autonomously selforganize the network taking into account a number of factors such as realtime network congestion statistics as well as application qos requirements 24 the purpose of this paper is to highlight the important advances in unsupervised learning and after providing a tutorial introduction to these techniques to review how such techniques have been or could be used for various tasks in modern nextgeneration networks comprising both computer networks as well as mobile telecom networks a contribution of the paper to the best of our knowledge there does not exist a survey that speci cally focuses on the important applications of unsu

data like other learning algorithms feature learning is also divided among domains of supervised and unsupervised learning depending on the type of available data almost all unsupervised learning algorithms undergo a stage of feature extraction in order to learn data representation from unlabeled data and generate 65582 volume 7 2019m usama et al unsupervised machine learning for networking techniques applications and research challenges table 2 list of common acronyms used a feature vector on the basis of which further tasks are performed hierarchical learning is intimately related to how deep learning is performed in modern multilayer neural networks in particular deep learning techniques bene ts from the fundamental concept of arti cial neural networks anns a deep structure consists of multiple hidden layers with mul tiple neurons in each layer a nonlinear activation function a cost function and a backpropagation algorithm deep learning 40 is a hierarchical technique that models high level abstraction in data using many layers of linear and nonlinear transformations with deep enough stack of thesetransformation layers a machine can selflearn a very com plex model or representation of data learning takes place in hidden layers and the optimal weights and biases of the neurons are updated in two passes namely the forward pass and backward pass a typical ann and typical cyclic and acyclic topologies of interconnection between neurons are shown in figure 3 a brief taxonomy of unsupervised nns is presented in figure 4 an ann has three types of layers namely input hidden and output each having different activation parameters learning is the process of assigning optimal activation parameters enabling ann to perform input to output mapping for a given problem an ann may require multiple hidden layers involving a long chain of computa tions ie its depth 41 deep learning has revolutionized ml and is now increasingly being used in diverse settings eg object identi cation in images speech transcription into text matching users interests with items such as news items movies products and making recommendations etc but until 2006 relatively few people were interested in deep learning due to the high computational cost of deep learning procedures it was widely believed that training deep learning architectures in an unsupervised manner was intractable and supervised the training of deep nns dnn also showed poor performance with large generalization errors 42 however recent advances 4345 have shown that deep learning can be performed ef ciently by separate unsupervised pre training of each layer with the results revolutionizing the eld of ml starting from the input observation layer which acts as an input to the subsequent layers pretraining tends to learn data distributions while the usual supervised stage performs a local search for netuning 1 unsupervised multilayer feed forward nn unsupervised multilayer feedforward nn with reference to graph theory has a directed graph topology as shown in figure 3 it consists of no cycles ie does not have a feed back path in input propagation through nn such kind of nn is often used to approximate a nonlinear mapping between inputs and required outputs autoencoders are the prime examples of unsupervised multilayer feedforward nns a autoencoders an autoencoder is an unsupervised learning algorithm for ann used to learn compressed and encoded representation of data mostly for dimensionality reduction and for unsu pervised pretraining of feedforward nns autoencoders are generally designed using approximation function and trained using backpropagation and stochastic gradient descent sgd techniques autoencoders are the rst of their kind to use the backpropagation algorithm to train with unlabeled data autoencoders aim to learn a compact representation of the function of input using the same number of input and output units with usually less hidden units to encode a feature vector they learn the input data function by recreating the input at the output which is called encodingdecoding to learn volume 7 2019 65583m usama et al unsupervised machine learning for networking techniques applications and research challenges figure 3 illustration of an ann left different types of ann topologies right figure 4 taxonomy of unsupervised neural networks at the time of training nn in short a simple autoencoder learns a lowdimensional representation of the input data by exploiting similar recurring patterns autoencoders have different variants 46 such as vari ational autoencoders sparse autoencoders and denoising autoencoders variational autoencoder is an unsupervised learning technique used clustering dimensionality reduction and visualization and for learning complex distributions 47 in asparse autoencoder a sparse penalty on the latent layer is applied for extracting a unique statistical feature from unlabeled data finally denoising autoencoders are used to learn the mapping of a corrupted data point to its original location in the data space in an unsupervised manner for manifold learning and reconstruction distribution learning 2 unsupervised competitive learning nn unsupervised competitive learning nns is a winnertakeall neuron scheme where each neuron competes for the right of the response to a subset of the input data this scheme is used to remove the redundancies from the unstructured data two major techniques of unsupervised competitive learning nns are selforganizing maps and adaptive resonance theory nnsa selforganizing kohonen maps selforganizing maps som also known as kohonens maps 48 49 are a special class of nns that uses the concept of competitive learning in which output neurons compete amongst themselves to be activated in a realvalued output results having only single neuron or group of neu rons called winning neuron this is achieved by creat ing lateral inhibition connections negative feedback paths between neurons 50 in this orientation the network deter mines the winning neuron within several iterations subse quently it is forced to reorganize itself based on the input data distribution hence they are called selforganizing maps they were initially inspired by the human brain which has specialized regions in which different sensory inputs are rep resentedprocessed by topologically ordered computational maps in som neurons are arranged on vertices of a lattice commonly one or two dimensions the network is forced to represent higherdimensional data in lowerdimensional representation by preserving the topological properties of input data by using neighborhood function while transform ing the input into a topological space in which neuron posi tions in the space are representatives of intrinsic statistical 65584 volume 7 2019m usama et al unsupervised machine learning for networking techniques applications and research challenges features that tell us about the inherently nonlinear nature of soms training a network comprising som is essentially a threestage process after random initialization of weighted connections the three stages are as follow 51 competition each neuron in the network computes its value using a discriminant function which provides the basis of competition among the neurons neuron with the largest discriminant value in the competition group is declared the winner cooperation the winner neuron then locates the center of the topological neighborhood of excited neurons in the previous stage providing a basis for cooperation among excited neighboring neurons adaption the excited neurons in the neighborhood increasedecrease their individual values of the discrimi nant function in regard to input data distribution through subtle adjustments such that the response of the winning neuron is enhanced for similar subsequent input adap tion stage is distinguishable into two substages 1 the ordering or selforganizing phase in which weight vec tors are reordered according to topological space and 2 the convergence phase in which the map is ne tuned and declared accurate to provide statistical quan ti cation of the input space this is the phase in which the map is declared to be converged and hence trained one essential requirement in training a som is the redundancy of the input data to learn about the underlying structure of neuron activation patterns moreover suf cient quantity of data is required for creating distinguishable clus ters withstanding enough data for classi cation problem there exist a problem of gray area between clusters and cre ation of in nitely small clusters where input data has minimal patterns b adaptive resonance theory adaptive resonance theory art is another different cat egory of nn models that is based on the theory of human cognitive information processing it can be explained as an algorithm of incremental clustering which aims at forming multidimensional clusters automatically discriminating and creating new categories based on input data primarily art models are classi ed as an unsupervised learning model however there exist art variants that employ supervised and semisupervised learning approaches as well the main setback of most nn models is that they lose old information updatingdiminishing weights as new information arrives therefore an ideal model should be exible enough to accom modate new information without losing the old one and this is called the plasticitystability problem art models provide a solution to this problem by selforganizing in real time and creating a competitive environment for neurons automati cally discriminatingcreating new clusters among neurons to accommodate any new information art model resonates around topdown observer expectations and bottomup sensory information whilekeeping their difference within the threshold limits of vigi lance parameter which in result is considered as the member of the expected class of neurons 52 learning of an art model primarily consists of a comparison eld recognition eld vigilance threshold parameter and a reset module the comparison eld takes an input vector which in result is passed to best match in the recognition eld the best match is the current winning neuron each neuron in the recognition eld passes a negative output in proportion to the quality of the match which inhibits other outputs therefore exhibiting lateral inhibitions competitions once the winning neuron is selected after a competition with the best match to the input vector the reset module compares the quality of the match to the vigilance threshold if the winning neuron is within the threshold it is selected as the output else the winning neuron is reset and the process is started again to nd the next best match to the input vector in case where no neuron is capable to pass the threshold test a search procedure begins in which the reset module disables recognition neurons one at a time to nd a correct match whose weight can be adjusted to accom modate the new match therefore art models are called self organizing and can deal with the plasticitystability dilemma",

a probabilitybased generative graph model that is composed of hierarchical layers of stochastic latent variables having binary valued activations which are referred as hidden units or feature

dbn learns to reconstruct its input each layer acting as feature detectors dbn can be trained by greedy layerwise training starting from the top layer with raw input subsequent layers are trained with the input data from the previously visible layer 43 once the network is trained in an unsupervised manner and learned the distribution of the data it can be netuned using supervised learning methods or supervised layers can be concatenated in order to achieve the desired task for instance classi cation b deep autoencoder another famous type of dbn is the deep autoencoder which is composed of two

neurons and volume 7 2019 65585m usama et al unsupervised machine learning for networking techniques applications and research challenges therefore the central layer between both dbns is the actual compressed feature vector c convolutional nn convolutional nn cnn are feed forward nn in which neurons are adapted to respond to overlapping regions in twodimensional input elds such as visual or audio input it is commonly achieved by local sparse connections among successive layers and tied shared weights followed by rec tifying and pooling layers which results in transformation invariant feature extraction another advantage of cnn over simple multilayer nn is that it is comparatively easier to train due to sparsely connected layers with the same number of hidden units cnn represents the most signi cant type of architecture for computer vision as they solve two challenges with the conventional nns 1 scalable and computationally tractable algorithms are needed for processing high dimensional images and 2 algorithms should be transfor mation invariant since objects in an image can occur at an arbitrary position however most cnns are composed of supervised feature detectors in

44 ie greedy layerwise lower to higher training with unlabeled data cdbn is a promising scalable generative model for learn ing translation invariant hierarchical representation from any highdimensional unlabeled data in an unsupervised man ner taking advantage of both worlds ie dbn and cnn cnn being widely employed for computer vision applica tions can be employed in computer networks for optimiza tion of quality of experience qoe and quality of service qos of multimedia content delivery over networks which is an open research problem for nextgeneration computer networks 55 4 unsupervised recurrent nn recurrent nn rnn is the most complex type of nn and hence the nearest match to an actual human brain that processes sequential inputs it can learn temporal behaviors of a given training data rnn employs an internal memory per neuron to process such sequential inputs in order to exhibit the effect of the previous event on the next compared to feed forward nns rnn is a stateful network it may contain computational cycles among states and uses time as the parameter in the transition function from one unit to another being complex and recently developed it is an open research problem to create domainspeci c rnn models and train them with sequential data speci cally there are two 1maxpooling is an algorithm of selecting the most responsive receptive eld of a given interest regionperspectives of rnn to be discussed in the scope of this survey namely the depth of the architecture and the training of the network the depth in the case of a simple arti cial nn is the presence of hierarchical nonlinear intermediate layers between the input and output signals in the case of an rnn there are different hypotheses explaining the concept of depth one hypothesis suggests that rnns are inherently deep in nature when expanded with respect to sequential input there are a series of nonlinear computations between the input at time ti and the output at time tick however at an individual discrete time step certain tran sitions are neither deep nor nonlinear there exist inputto hidden hiddentohidden and hiddentooutput transitions which are shallow in the sense that there are no intermediate nonlinear layers at discrete time step in this regard different deep architectures are proposed in 56 that introduce inter mediate nonlinear transitional layers in between the input hidden and output layers another novel approach is also proposed by stacking hidden units to create a hierarchical representation of hidden units which mimic the deep nature of standard deep nns due to the inherently complex nature of rnn to the best of our knowledge there is no widely adopted approach for training rnns and many novel methods both supervised and unsupervised are introduced to train rnns considering unsupervised learning of rnn in the scope of this paper 57 employ long shortterm memory lstm rnn to be trained in an unsupervised manner using unsupervised learning algo rithms namely binary information gain optimization and non parametric entropy optimization in order to make a network to discriminate between a set of temporal sequences and cluster them into groups results have shown remarkable ability of rnns for learning temporal sequences and cluster ing them based on a variety of features two major types of unsupervised recurrent nn are hop eld nn and boltzmann machine a hopfield nn hop eld nn is a cyclic recurrent nn where each node is connected to others hop eld nn provides an abstraction of circular shift register memory with nonlinear activation functions to form a global energy function with guaranteed convergence to local minima hop eld nns are used for nding clusters in the data without a supervisor b boltzmann machine the boltzmann machine is a stochastic symmetric recur rent nn that is used for search and learning problems due to binary vector based simple learning algorithm of boltzmann machine very interesting features representing the complex unstructured data can be learned 58 since the boltzmann machine uses multiple hidden layers as fea ture detectors the learning algorithm becomes very slow to avoid slow learning and to achieve faster feature detection instead of boltzmann machine a faster version namely the restricted boltzmann machine rbm is used for practical 65586 volume 7 2019m usama et al unsupervised machine learning for networking techniques applications and research challenges figure 5 clustering process problems 59 restricted boltzmann machine learns a prob ability distribution over its input data but since it is restricted in its layer to layer connectivity rbm loses its property of recurrence it is faster than a boltzmann machine because it only uses one hidden layer as a feature detector layer rbm is used for dimensionality reduction clustering and feature learning in computer networks 5 significant applications of hierarchical learning in networks annsdnns are the most researched topic when creat ing intelligent systems in computer vision and natural lan guage processing whereas their application in computer networks are very limited they are employed in differ ent networking applications such as classi cation of traf c anomalyintrusion detection detecting distributed denial of service ddos attacks and resource management in cogni tive radios 60 the motivation of using dnn for learning and predicting in networks is the unsupervised training that detects hidden patterns in ample amount of data that is near to impossible for a human to handcraft features catering for all scenarios moreover many new research shows that a single model is not enough for the need of some applications so developing a hybrid nn architecture having pros and cons of different models creates a new ef cient nn which provides even better results such an approach is used in 61 in which a hybrid model of art and rnn is employed to learn and predict traf c volume in a computer network in real time realtime prediction is essential to adaptive ow control which is achieved by using hybrid techniques so that art can learn new input patterns without retraining the entire network and can predict accurately in the time series of rnn furthermore dnns are also being used in resource allocation and qoeqos optimizations using nn for opti mization ef cient resource allocation without affecting the user experience can be crucial in the time when resources are scarce authors of 62 63 propose a simple dbn for opti mizing multimedia content delivery over wireless

unsupervised learning task that aims to nd hidden patterns in unlabeled input data in the form of clus ters 64 simply put it encompasses the arrangement of data in meaningful natural groupings on the basis of the similarity between different features as illustrated in figure 5 to learn about its structure clustering involves the organization of data in such a way that there are high intracluster

various applications mcgregor et al 67 propose an ef cient packet tracing approach using the expectationmaximization em proba bilistic clustering algorithm which groups ows packets into a small number of clusters where the goal is to analyze network traf c using a set of representative clusters a brief overview of different types of clustering methods and their relationships can be seen in figure 6 clustering can be divided into three main types 68 namely hierarchical clustering bayesian clustering and partitional clustering hierarchical clustering creates a hierarchical decomposition of data whereas bayesian clustering forms a probabilistic model of the data that decides the fate of a new test point probabilistically in contrast partitional clustering constructs multiple partitions and evaluates them on the basis of certain criterion or characteristic such as the euclidean distance before delving into the general subtypes of clustering there are two unique clustering techniques which need to be discussed namely densitybased clustering andgridbased clustering in some cases densitybased clustering is classi ed as a partitional clustering technique however we have kept it separate considering its applications in networking densitybased models target the most densely populated area of data space and separate it from areas having low densities thus forming clusters 69 70

technique is gridbased clustering which divides the data space into cells to form a gridlike structure subsequently all clustering actions are performed on this grid 71 71 also present a novel approach that uses a customized grid based clustering algorithm to detect anomalies in networks 72 proposed a novel method for clustering the time series data this scheme was based on a distance

hierarchical clustering is a wellknown strategy in data min ing and statistical analysis in which data is clustered into a hierarchy of clusters using an agglomerative bottomup or a divisive topdown approach almost all hierarchical clus tering algorithms are unsupervised and deterministic the primary advantage of hierarchical clustering over unsuper vised kmeans and em algorithms is that it does not require the number of clusters to be speci ed beforehand however this advantage comes at the cost of computational ef ciency common hierarchical clustering algorithms have at least 65588 volume 7

a set of latent or hidden vari ables latent variable model allows us to express relatively complex distributions in terms of tractable joint distributions over an expanded variable space 95 underlying variables of a process are represented in higher dimensional space using a xed transformation and stochastic variations are known as latent variable models where the distribution in higher dimension is due to small number of hidden variables acting in a combination 96 these models are used for data visualization dimensionality reduction optimization distribution learning blind signal separation

estimating the underlying density functionmixture distribution provides a general framework for den sity estimation by using the simpler parametric distributions expectation maximization em algorithm is used for esti mating the mixture distribution model 97 through max imization of the loglikelihood of the mixture distribution model 2 factor analysis another important type of latent variable model is factor analysis which is a density estimation model it has been used quite often in collaborative ltering and dimensionality reduction it is different from other latent variable models in terms of the allowed variance for different dimensions as most latent variable models for dimensionality reduction in conventional settings use a xed variance gaussian noise model in the factor analysis model latent variables have diagonal covariance rather than isotropic covariance 3 blind signal separation blind signal separation bss also referred to as blind source separation is the identi cation and separation of independent source signals from mixed input signals with out or very little information about the mixing process figure 7depicts the basic bss process in which source signals are extracted from a mixture of signals it is a funda mental and challenging problem in the domain of signal pro cessing although the concept is extensively used in all types of multidimensional data

blindly processed ie with no or minimal information about the mixing process to show the original signals principal components principal components are arranged in the descending order of their variability rst one catering for the most variable and the last one for the least being a primary technique for exploratory data analysis pca takes a cloud of data in ndimensions and rotates it such that maxi mum variability in the data is visible using this technique it brings out the strong patterns in the dataset so that these patterns are more recognizable thereby making the data easier to explore and visualize pca has primarily been used for dimensionality reduction in which input data of ndimensions is reduced to kdimen sions without losing critical information in the data the choice of the number of principal components is a question of the design decision much research has been conducted on selecting the number of components such as crossvalidation approximations 98 optimally kis chosen such that the ratio of the average squared projection error to the total variation in the data is less than or equal to 1 by which 99 of the variance is retained in the kprincipal components but depending on the application domain different designs can increasedecrease the ratio while maximizing the required output commonly many features of a dataset are often highly correlated hence pca results in retaining 99 of the variance while signi cantly reducing the data dimensions b independent component analysis ica is another tech nique for bss that focuses on separating multivariate input data into additive components with the underlying assump tion that the components are nongaussian and statistically independent the most common example to understand ica is the cocktail party problem in which there are npeople talking simultaneously in a room and one tries to listen to a single voice ica actually separates source signals from input mixed signal by either minimizing the statistical depen dence or maximizing the nongaussian property among the components in the input signals by keeping the underly ing assumptions valid statistically ica can be seen as the extension of pca while pca tries to maximize the second moment variance of data hence relying heavily on gaussian features on the other hand ica exploits inherently non gaussian features of the

information coding theory table 5also provides a tabulated description of latent variable models applications in networking d dimensionality reduction representing data in fewer dimensions is another well established task of unsupervised learning real world data often have high dimensionsin many datasets these dimen sions can run into thousands even millions of potentially correlated dimensions 133 however it is observed that the intrinsic dimensionality governing parameters of the data is less than the total number of dimensions in order to nd the essential pattern of the underlying data by extracting intrinsic dimensions it is necessary that the real essence is not lost eg it may be the case that a phenomenon is observable only in higherdimensional data and is suppressed in lower dimensions these phenomena are said to suffer from the curse of dimensionality 134 while dimensionality reduc tionis sometimes used interchangeably with feature selection 135 136 a subtle difference exists between the two 137 feature selection is traditionally performed as a supervised task with a domain expert helping in handcrafting a set of critical features of the data such an approach generally can perform well but is not scalable and prone to judgment bias dimensionality reduction on the other hand is more generally an unsupervised task where instead of choosing a subset of features it creates new features dimensions as a function of all features said differently feature selection considers supervised data labels while dimensionality reduc tion focuses on the data points and their distributions in an ndimensional space there exist different techniques for reducing data dimen sions 138 including projection of higher dimensional points onto lower dimensions independent representation and sparse representation which should be capable of recon structing the approximate data dimensionality reduction is useful for data modeling compression and visualization 65592 volume 7 2019m usama et al unsupervised machine learning for networking techniques applications and research challenges table 5 applications of latent variable models in networking applications by creating representative functional dimensions of the data and eliminating redundant ones it becomes easier to visualize and form a learning model independent representation tries to disconnect the source of variation underlying the data distribution such that the dimensions of the representation are statistically independent 40 sparse representation tech nique represents the data vectors in linear combinations of small basis vectors it is worth noting here that many of the latent variable mod els eg pca ica factor analysis also function as tech niques for dimensionality reduction in addition to techniques such as pca icawhich infer the latent inherent structure of the data through a linear projection of the dataa number of nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques have also been developed and will be focused upon in this section to avoid repetition of linear dimensionality reduction techniques that have already been covered as part of the previous subsec tion linear dimensionality reduction techniques are useful in many settings but these methods may miss important nonlin ear structure in the data due to their subspace assumption which posits that the highdimensional data points lie on a linear subspace for example on a 2d or 3d plane such an assumption fails in high dimensions when data points are random but highly correlated with neighbors in such environ ments nonlinear dimensionality reductions through manifold learning techniqueswhich can be construed as an attempt to generalize linear frameworks like pca so that nonlinear structure in data can also be recognizedbecome desirableeven though some supervised variants also exist manifold learning is mostly performed in an unsupervised fashion using the nonlinear manifold substructure learned from the highdimensional structure of the data from the data itself without the use of any predetermined classi er or labeled data some nonlinear dimensionality reduction manifold learning techniques are described below 1 isomap isomap is a nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique that nds the underlying low dimensional geometric information about a dataset algorithmic features of pca and mds are combined to learn the low dimensional nonlinear man ifold structure in the data 139 isomap uses geodesic dis tance along the shortest path to calculate the low dimension representation shortest path which can be computed using dijkstras algorithm 2 generative topographic model generative topographic mapping gtm represents the nonlinear latent variable mapping from continuous low dimensional distributions embedded in high dimensional spaces 140 data space in gtm is represented as reference vectors and these vectors are a projection of latent points in data space it is a probabilistic variant of som and works by calculating the euclidean distance between data points gtm optimizes the loglikelihood function and the resulting probability de nes the density in data space

higher dimensional embedding lle depicts data in a single global coordinate of lower dimensional mapping of input data lle is used to visualize multidimensional dimensional manifolds and feature extraction 4 principal curves the principal curve is a nonlinear dataset summarizing tech nique where nonparametric curves pass through the middle of multidimensional dataset providing the summary of the dataset 141 these smooth curves minimize the average squared orthogonal distance between data points this process also resembles the maximum likelihood for nonlinear regres sion in the presence of gaussian noise 142 5 nonlinear multidimensional scaling nonlinear multidimensional scaling nmds 143 is a non linear latent variable representation scheme it works as an alternative scheme for factor analysis in factor analysis a multivariate normal distribution is assumed and similari ties between different objects are expressed as a correlation matrix whereas nmds does not impose such a condition and it is designed to reach the optimal low dimensional con guration where similarities and dissimilarities among matri ces can be observed nmds is also used in data visualization and mining tools for depicting the multidimensional data in 3 dimensions based on the similarities in the distance matrix 6 tdistributed stochastic neighbor embedding tdistributed stochastic neighbor embedding tsne is another nonlinear dimensionality reduction scheme it is used to represent high dimensional data in 2 or 3 dimensionstsne constructs a probability distribution in high dimen sional space and constructs a similar distribution in lower dimensions and minimizes the kullbackaleibler kl divergence between two distributions which is a useful way to measure the difference between two probability distributions 144 table 6 also provides a tabulated description of dimen sionality reduction applications in networking the applica tions of nonlinear dimensionality reduction methods are later described in detail in section iiid e outlier detection outlier detection is an important application of unsupervised learning a sample point that is distant from other samples is called an outlier an outlier may occur due to noise measure ment error heavy tail distributions and a mixture of two dis tributions there are two popular underlying techniques for unsupervised outlier detection upon which many algorithms are designed namely the nearest neighbor based technique and clustering based method 1 nearest neighbor based outlier detection the nearest neighbor method works on estimating the euclidean distances or average distance of every sample from all other samples in the dataset there are many algorithms based on nearest neighbor based techniques with the most famous extension of the nearest neighbor being a knearest neighbor technique in which only k nearest neighbors par ticipate in the outlier detection 154 local outlier factor is another outlier detection algorithm which works as an exten sion of the knearest neighbor algorithm connectivitybased outlier factors 155 in uenced outlierness 156 and local outlier probability models 157 are few famous examples of the nearest neighbor based techniques 65594 volume 7 2019m usama et al unsupervised machine learning for networking techniques applications and research challenges 2 cluster based outlier detection clustering based methods use the conventional kmeans clustering technique to nd dense locations in the data and then perform density estimation on those clusters after den sity estimation a heuristic is used to classify the formed clus ter according to the cluster size anomaly score is computed by calculating the distance between every point and its cluster head local density cluster based outlier factor 158 cluster ing based multivariate gaussian outlier score 159 160 and histogram based outlier score 161 are the famous cluster based outlier detection models in literature svm and pca are also suggested for outlier detection in literature 3 significant applications of outlier detection in networks outlier detection algorithms are used in many different appli cations such as intrusion detection fraud detection data leak age prevention surveillance energy consumption anomalies forensic analysis critical state detection in designs elec trocardiogram and computed tomography scan for tumor detection unsupervised anomaly detection is performed by estimating the distances and densities of the provided non annotated data 162 more applications of outlier detection schemes will be discussed in section iii f lessons learnt key lessons drawn from the review of unsupervised learning techniques are summarized below 1 hierarchical learning techniques are the most pop ular schemes in literature for feature detection and extraction 2 learning the joint distribution of a complex distribution over an expanded variable space is a dif cult task latent variable models have been the recommended and wellestablished schemes in literature for this prob lem these models are also used for dimensionality reduction and better representation of data 3 visualization of unlabeled multidimensional data is another unsupervised task in this research we have explored the dimensionality reduction as an underlying scheme for developing better multidimensional data visualization tools",

        "prompt": "iii applications of unsupervised learning in networking in this section we will introduce some signi cant appli cations of the unsupervised learning techniques that have been discussed in section iiin the context of computer net works we highlight the broad spectrum of applications in networking and emphasize the importance of mlbased tech niques rather than classical hardcoded statistical methods for achieving more ef ciency adaptability and performance enhancement a internet traffic classification internet traf c classi cation is of prime importance in net working as it provides a way to understand develop andmeasure the internet internet traf c classi cation is an important component for service providers to understand the characteristics of the service such as quality of service quality of experience user behavior network security and many other key factors related to the overall structure of a network 163 in this subsection we will survey the unsuper vised learning applications in network traf c classi cation as networks evolve at a rapid pace malicious intruders are also evolving their strategies numerous novel hacking and intrusion techniques are being regularly introduced causing severe nancial jolts to companies and headaches to their administrators tackling these unknown intrusions through accurate traf c classi cation on the network edge therefore becomes a critical challenge and an important component of the network security domain initially when networks used to be small simple portbased classi cation technique that tried to identify the associated application with the corre sponding packet based on its port number was used however this approach is now obsolete because recent malicious soft ware uses a dynamic portnegotiation mechanism to bypass rewalls and security applications a number of contrast ing internet traf c classi cation techniques have been pro posed since then and some important ones are discussed next most of the modern traf c classi cation methods use different ml and clustering techniques to produce accurate clusters of packets depending on their applications thus pro ducing ef cient packet classi cation 10 the main purpose of classifying networks traf c is to recognize the destination application of the corresponding packet and to control the ow of the traf c when needed such as prioritizing one ow over others another important aspect of traf c classi cation is to detect intrusions and malicious attacks or screen out forbidden applications packets the rst step in classifying internet traf c is selecting accurate features which is an extremely important yet com plex task accurate feature selection helps ml algorithms to avoid problems like class imbalance low ef ciency and low classi cation rate there are three major feature selec tion methods in internet traf c for classi cation the l ter method the wrapper based method and the embedded method these methods are based on different ml and genetic learning algorithms 164 two major concerns in feature selection for internet traf c classi cation are the large size of data and imbalanced traf c classes to deal with these issues and to ensure accurate feature selection a minmax ensemble feature selection scheme is proposed in 165 a new informationtheoretic approach for feature selection for skewed datasets is described in 166 this algorithm has resolved the multiclass imbalance issue but it does not resolve the issues of feature selection in 2017 an unsupervised autoencoder based scheme has outperformed previous feature learning schemes autoencoders were used as a generative model and were trained in a way that the bottleneck layer learned a latent representation of the feature set these features were then used for malware classi cation volume 7 2019 65595m usama et al unsupervised machine learning for networking techniques applications and research challenges and anomaly detection to produce results that improved the state of the art in feature selection 30 much work has been done on classifying traf c based on supervised ml techniques initially in 2004 the concept of clustering bidirectional ows of packets came out with the use of em probabilistic clustering algorithm which clusters the ows depending on various attributes such as packet size statistics interarrival statistics byte counts and connection duration etc 67 furthermore clustering is combined with the above model 172 this strategy uses naive bayes clus tering to classify traf c in an automated fashion recently unsupervised ml techniques have also been introduced in the domain of network security for classifying traf c major developments include a hybrid model to classify traf c in more unsupervised manner 173 which uses both labeled and unlabeled data to train the classi er making it more durable and ef cient however later on completely unsuper vised methods for traf c classi cation have been proposed and still much work is going on in this area initially a com pletely unsupervised approach for traf c classi cation was employed using the kmeans clustering algorithm combined with log transformation to classify data into corresponding clusters then 78 highlighted that using kmeans and this method for traf c classi cation can improve accuracy by 10 to achieve an overall 90 accuracy another improved and faster approach was proposed in 2006 174 which examines the size of the rst ve packets and determines the application correctly using unsu pervised learning techniques this approach has shown to produce better results than the stateoftheart traf c classi er and also has removed its drawbacks such as dealing with outliers or unknown packets etc another similar auto mated traf c classi er and application identi er can be seen in 175 and they use the autoclass unsupervised bayesian classi er which automatically learns the inherent natural classes in a dataset in 2013 another novel strategy for traf c classi cation known as network traf c classi cation using correlation was proposed 167 which uses nonparametric nn combined with statistical measurement of correlation within data to ef ciently classify traf c the presented approach addressed the three major drawbacks of supervised and unsupervised learning classi cation models rstly they are inappropriate for sparse complex networks as labeling of training data takes too much computation and time secondly many supervised schemes such as svm are not robust to training data size and lastly and most importantly all supervised and unsupervised algorithms perform poorly if there are few training samples thus classifying the traf c using correlations appears to be more ef cient and adapting 176 compared four ann approaches for computer network traf c and modeled the internet traf c like a time series and used mathematical methods to predict the time series a greedy layerwise train ing for unsupervised stacked autoencoder produced excellent classi cation results but at the cost of signi cant system complexity genetic algorithm combined with constraintclustering process is used for internet traf c data characteri zation 177 in another work a twophased ml approach for internet traf c classi cation using kmeans and c50 deci sion tree is presented in 178 where the average accuracy of classi cation was 9237 a new approach for internet traf c classi cation has been introduced in 2017 by 88 in which unidirectional and bidi rectional information is extracted from the collected traf c and kmeans clustering is performed on the basis of statistical properties of the extracted ows a supervised classi er then classi es these clusters another unsupervised learning based algorithm for internet traf c detection is described in 179 where a restricted boltzmann machine based svm is pro posed for traf c detection this paper model the detection as a classi cation problem results were compared with ann and decision tree algorithms on the basis of precision and recall application of deep learning algorithms in internet traf c classi cation has been discussed in 16 with this work also outlining the open research challenges in applying deep learning for internet traf c classi cation these problems are related to training the models for big data since internet data for deep learning falls in big data regime optimiza tion issues of the designed models given the uncertainty in internet traf c and scalability of deep learning architectures in internet traf c classi cation to cope with the challenges of developing a exible highperformance platform that can capture data from a highspeed network operating at more than 60 gbps 180 have introduced a platform for high speed packet to tuple sequence conversion which can sig ni cantly advance the state of the art in realtime network traf c classi cation in another work 181 used stacked autoencoders for internet traf c classi cation and produced more than 90 accurate results for the two classes in kdd 99 dataset deep belief network combined with gaussian model employed for internet traf c prediction in wireless mesh backbone network has been shown to outperform the pre vious maximum likelihood estimation technique for traf c prediction 182 given the uncertainty of wlan channel traf c classi cation is very tricky 169 proposed a new variant of gaussian mixture model by incorporating universal background model and used it for the rst time to classify the wlan traf c a brief overview of the different internet traf c classi cation systems classi ed on the basis of unsu pervised technique and tasks discussed earlier is presented in the table 7 b anomalyintrusion detection the increasing use of networks in every domain has increased the risk of network intrusions which makes user privacy and the security of critical data vulnerable to attacks according to the annual computer crime and security survey 2005 199 conducted by the combined teams of csi computer security institute and fbi federal bureau of investigation total nancial losses faced by companies due to the security attacks and network intrusions were estimated as us 130 million 65596 volume 7 2019m usama et al unsupervised machine learning for networking techniques applications and research challenges table 7 internet traffic classification with respect to unsupervised learning techniques and tasks moreover according to the symantec internet security threat report 200 approximately 5000 new vulnerabilities were identi ed in the year 2015 in addition more than 400 million new variants of malware programs and 9 major breaches were detected exposing 10 million identities there fore insecurity in todays networking environment has given rise to the everevolving domain of network security and intrusionanomaly detection 200 in general intrusion detection systems ids recognize or identify any act of security breach within a computer or a network speci cally all requests which could compromise the con dentiality and availability of data or resources of a system or a particular network generally intrusion detection systems can be categorized into three types 1 signature based intrusion detection systems 2 anomaly detection systems and 3 compoundhybrid detection systems which include selective attributes of both preceding systems signature detection also known as misuse detection is a technique that was initially used for tracing and identify ing misuses of users important data computer resources and intrusions in the network based on the previously col lected or stored signatures of intrusion attempts the most important bene t of a signaturebased system is that a com puter administrator can exactly identify the type of attack a computer is currently experiencing based on the sequence of the packets de ned by stored signatures however it is nearly impossible to maintain the signature database of all evolving possible attacks thus this pitfall of the signature based technique has given rise to anomaly detection systems anomaly detection system ads is a modern intrusion and anomaly detection system initially it creates a baseline image of a system pro le its network and user program activity then on the basis of this baseline image ads classi es any activity deviating from this behavior as an intrusion few bene ts of this technique are rstly they are capableof detecting insider attacks such as using system resources through another user pro le secondly each ads is based on a customized user pro le which makes it very dif cult for attackers to ascertain which types of attacks would not set an alarm and lastly it detects unknown behavior in a computer system rather than detecting intrusions thus it is capable of detecting any unknown sophisticated attack which is different from the users usual behavior however these bene ts come with a tradeoff in which the process of training a system on a users normal pro le and maintaining those pro les is a time consuming and challenging task if an inappropriate user pro le is created it can result in poor performance since ads detects any behavior that does not align with a users normal pro le its false alarm rate can be high lastly another pitfall of ads is that a malicious user can train ads gradually to accept inappropriate traf c as normal as anomaly and intrusion detection have been a popular research area since the origin of networking and internet numerous supervised as well as unsupervised 201 learning techniques have been applied to ef ciently detect intrusions and malicious activities however latest research focuses on the application of unsupervised learning techniques in this area due to the challenge and promise of using big data for optimizing networks initial work focuses on the application of basic unsu pervised clustering algorithms for detecting intrusions and anomalies in 2005 an unsupervised approach was proposed based on density and gridbased clustering to accurately classify the highdimensional dataset in a set of clusters those points which do not fall in any cluster are marked as abnormal 71 this approach has produced good results but the false positive rate was very high in followup work another improved approach that used fuzzy rough cmeans clustering was introduced 85 195 kmeans clustering is also another famous approach used for detecting anomalies volume 7 2019 65597m usama et al unsupervised machine learning for networking techniques applications and research challenges which were later proposed in 2009 79 which showed great accuracy and outperformed existing unsupervised methods however later in 2012 an improved method which used kmeans clustering combined with the c45 decision tree algorithm was proposed 192 to produce more ef cient results than prior approaches 202 combines cluster centers and nearest neighbors for effective feature representation which ensures a better intrusion detection however a limi tation with this approach is that it is not able to detect user to resource and remote to local attacks another scheme using unsupervised learning approach for anomaly detection is pre sented in 203 the presented scheme combines subspace clustering and correlation analysis to detect anomalies and provide protection against unknown anomalies this exper iment used wide backbone networks data 204 spanning over six years and produced better results than previous kmeans based techniques work presented in 205 shows that for different intrusions schemes there are a small set of measurements required to differentiate between normal and anomalous traf c the authors used two coclustering schemes to perform clustering and to determine which measurement subset contributed the most towards accurate detection another famous approach for increasing detection accu racy is ensemble learning work presented in 206 employed many hybrid incremental ml approaches with gradient boosting and ensemble learning to achieve better detection performance authors in 207 surveyed anomaly detection research from 2009 to 2014 and nd out the unique algo rithmic similarity for anomaly detection in internet traf c most of the algorithms studied have following sim ilarities 1 removal of redundant information in training phase to ensure better learning performance 2 feature selec tion usually performed using unsupervised techniques and increases the accuracy of detection 3 use ensembles clas si ers or hybrid classi ers rather than baseline algorithms to get better results authors in 208 have developed an arti cial immune system based intrusion detection system they have used densitybased spatial clustering of applica tions with noise to develop an immune system against the network intrusion detection the application of unsupervised intrusion detection in cloud network is presented in 209 where authors have pro posed a fuzzy clustering ann to detect the less frequent attacks and improve the detection stability in cloud networks another application of unsupervised intrusion detection sys tem for clouds is surveyed in 210 where fuzzy logic based intrusion detection system using supervised and unsupervised ann is proposed for intrusion detection this approach is used for dos and ddos attacks where the scale of the attack is very large network intrusion anomaly detection system nids based on kmeans clustering are surveyed in 211 this survey is unique as it provides distance and similarity measure of the intrusion detection and this perspective has not been studied before 2015 unsupervised learning based appli cations of anomaly detection schemes for wireless personalarea networks wireless sensor networks cyberphysical sys tems and wlans are surveyed in 212 another paper 213 reviewing anomaly detection has pre sented the application of unsupervised svm and clustering based applications in network intrusion detection systems unsupervised discretization algorithm is used in bayesian network classi er for intrusion detection which is based on bayesian model averaging 214 the authors show that the proposed algorithm performs better than the naive bayes classi er in terms of accuracy on the nslkdd intru sion detection dataset border gateway protocol bgp the core internet interautonomous systems interas rout ing protocolis also error prone to intrusions and anoma lies to detect these bgp anomalies many supervised and unsupervised ml solutions such as hidden markov models and principal component analysis have been proposed in literature 215 another problem for anomaly detection is low volume attacks which have become a big challenge for network traf c anomaly detection while longrange depen dencies lrd are used to identify these low volume attacks lrd usually works on aggregated traf c volume but since the volume of traf c is low the attacks can pass undetected to accurately identify low volume abnormalities 216 pro posed the examination of lrd behavior of control plane and data plane separately to identify low volume attacks other than clustering another widely used unsupervised technique for detecting malicious and abnormal behavior in networks is soms the specialty of soms is that they can automatically organize a variety of inputs and deduce patterns among themselves and subsequently determine whether the new input ts in the deduced pattern or not thus detecting abnormal inputs 184 185 soms have also been used in hostbased intrusion detection systems in which intruders and abusers are identi ed at a host",

with respect to unsupervised learning techniques if there is any malfunctioning in the network it should be reported and addressed accordingly following is a summary of different network optimization tasks achieved through unsupervised learning models 1 qosqoe optimization qos and qoe are measures of service performance and end user experience respectively qos mainly deals with the performance as seen by the user being measured quantita tively while qoe is a qualitative measure of subjective met rics experienced by the user qosqoe for internet services especially multimedia content delivery services is crucial in order to maximize the user experience with the dynamic and bursty nature of internet traf c computer networks should be able to adapt to these changes without compromising enduser experiences as qoe is quite subjective it heavily relies on the underlying qos which is affected by different network parameters references 232 and 233 suggesteddifferent measurable factors to determine the overall approx imation of qos such as error rates bit rate throughput trans mission delay availability jitters etc furthermore these factors are used to correlate qos with qoe in the perspective of video streaming where qoe is essential to endusers the dynamic nature of the internet dictates network design for different applications to maximize qosqoe since there is no prede ned adaptive algorithm that can be used to ful ll all the necessary requirements for prospective application due to this fact ml approaches are employed in order to adapt to the realtime network conditions and take measures to stabilizemaximize the user experience reference 234 employed a hybrid architecture having unsupervised feature learning with a supervised classi cation for qoebased video admission control and resource management unsupervised feature learning in this system is carried out by using a fully connected nn comprising rbms which capture descriptive features of video

presents an algorithm to estimate the mean opinion score a metric for measuring qoe for voip services by using som to map quality metrics to features moreover research has shown that qoedriven content optimization leads to the optimal utilization of the network reference 236 showed that 43 of the bit overhead on average can be reduced per image delivered on the web this is achieved by using the quality metric voqs variation of quality signature which can arbitrarily compare two images in terms of web delivery performance by applying this met ric for unsupervised clustering of the large image dataset multiple coherent groups are formed in devicetargeted and contentdependent manner in another study 237 deep learning is used to assess the qoe of 3d images that have yet to show good results compared with the other determin istic algorithms the outcome is a reduced reference qoe assessment process for automatic image assessment and it has a signi cant potential to be extended to work on 3d video assessment in 238 a unique technique of the modelbased rl approach is applied to improve bandwidth availability and hence throughput performance of a network the mrl model is embedded in a node that creates a model of the operating environment and uses it to generate virtual states and rewards for the virtual actions taken as the agent does not need to wait for the real states and rewards from the operating environment it can explore various kinds of actions on the virtual operating environment within a short period of time which helps to expedite the learning process and hence the convergence rate to the optimal action in 239 a marl approach is applied in which nodes exchange qvalues among themselves and select their respective next hop nodes with the best possible channel conditions while forwarding packets towards the destination this helps to improve throughput performance as nodes in a network ensure that packets are successfully sent to the destination in a collaborative manner 2 tcp optimization transmission control protocol tcp is the core endtoend protocol in tcpip stack that provides reliable ordered and errorfree delivery of messages between two communicating hosts due to the fact that tcp provides reliable and inorder delivery congestion control is one of the major concerns of this protocol which is commonly dealt with the algorithms de ned in rfc 5681 however classical congestion control algorithms are suboptimal in hybrid wiredwireless networks as they react to packet loss in the same manner in all net work situations in order to overcome this shortcoming of classical tcp congestion control algorithms an mlbased approach is proposed in 240 which employs a supervised classi er based on features learned for classifying a packet loss due to congestion or link errors other approaches to this problem currently employed in literature include using rl that uses fuzzy logic based reward evaluator based ongame theory 241 another promising approach named remy 242 uses a modi ed model of markov decision pro cess based on three factors 1 prior knowledge about the network 2 a traf c model based on user needs ie through put and delay and 3 an objective function that is to be maximized by this learning approach a customized best suited congestion control scheme is produced speci cally for that part of the network adapted to its unique requirements however classifying packet losses using unsupervised learn ing methods is still an open research problem and there is a need for realtime adaptive congestion control mechanism

ned networks sdn self organizing networks son and the internet of things iot are expected to be the basis of future intelligent adaptive and dynamic networks 280 ml techniques will be at the center of this revolution provid 65602 volume 7 2019m usama et al unsupervised machine learning for networking techniques applications and research challenges ing the aforementioned properties this subsection covers the recent applications of unsupervised ml techniques in sdns sons and iots 1 software defined networks sdn is a disruptive new networking architecture that sim pli es network operating and managing tasks and provides infrastructural support for novel innovations by making the network programmable 281 in simple terms the idea of programmable networks is to simply decouple the data for warding plane and controldecision plane which is rather tightly coupled in the current infrastructure the use of sdn can also be seen in managing and optimizing networks as network operators go through a lot of hassle to imple ment highlevel security policies in term of distributed low level system con gurations thus sdn resolves this issue by decoupling the planes and giving network operators bet ter control and visibility over network enabling them to make frequent changes to network state and providing sup port for highlevel speci cation language for network con trol 282 sdn is applicable in a wide variety of areas ranging from enterprise networks data centers infrastructure based wireless access networks optical networks to home and small businesses each providing many future research opportunities 281 unsupervised ml techniques are seeing a surging interest in sdn community as can be seen by a spate of recent work a popular application of unsupervised ml techniques in sdns relates to the application of intrusion detection and mit igation of security attacks 283 another approach for detect ing anomalies in a cloud environment using unsupervised learning model has been proposed by 284 that uses som to capture emergent system behavior and predict unknown and novel anomalies without any prior training or con guration a ddos detection system for sdn is presented in 255 where stacked autoencoders are used to detect ddos attacks a density peak based clustering algorithm for ddos attack is proposed as a new method to review the potentials of using sdn to develop an ef cient anomaly detection method 285 286 have recently presented an intelligent threat aware response system for sdn using reinforcement learning this work also recommends using unsupervised feature learning to improve the threat detection process another framework for anomaly detection classi cation and mitigation for sdn is presented in 287 where unsupervised learning is used fortraf c feature analysis reference 288 have presented a forensic framework for sdn and recommended kmeans clustering for anomaly detection in sdn another work 289 discusses the potential opportunities for using unsupervised learning for traf c classi cation in sdn moreover deep learning and distributed processing can also be applied to such models in order to better adapt to evolving networks and contribute to the future of sdn infrastructure as a service 2 self organizing networks son is another new and popular research regime in network ing son is inspired by the biological system which worksin the selforganization and achieves the task by learning from the surrounding environment as the connected net work devices are growing exponentially and the communi cation cell size has reduced to femtocells the property of selforganization is becoming increasingly desirable 290 feasibility of son application in the fth generation 5g of wireless communication is studied in 291 and the study shows that without supervised as well as unsupervised ml support son is not possible application of ml tech niques in son has become a very important research area as it involves learning from the surroundings for intelligent decisionmaking and reliable communication 2 application of different mlbased son for heterogeneous networks is considered in 292 this paper also describes the unsupervised ann and hidden markov models tech niques employed for better learning from the surroundings and adapting accordingly pca and clustering are the two most used unsupervised learning schemes utilized for param eter optimization and feature learning in son 290 these ml schemes are used in selfcon guration selfhealing and selfoptimization schemes game theory is another unsuper vised learning approach used for designing selfoptimization and greedy selfcon guration design of son systems 293 authors in 294 proposed an unsupervised ann for link quality estimation of son which outperformed simple mov ing average and exponentially weighted moving averages 3 internet of things iot is an emerging paradigm with a growing academic and industry interest iot is an abstraction of intelligent phys ical and virtual devices with unique identities connected together to form a cyberphysical framework these devices collect analyze and transmit data to public or private cloud for intelligent 295 iot is a new networking paradigm and it is expected to be deployed in health care smart cities home automation agriculture and industry with such a vast plane of applications iot needs ml to collect and analyze data to make intelligent decisions the key challenge that iot must deal with is the extremely large scale billions of devices of future iot deployments",

manifold learning are potential areas of research in terms of dimensional ity reduction and visualization iv future work some research challenges and opportunities this section provides a discussion on some open directions for future work and the relevant opportunities in applying unsupervised ml in the eld of networking a simplified network management while new network architectures such as sdn have been proposed in recent years to simplify network management network operators are still expected to know too much and to correlate between what they know about how their network is designed with the current networks condition through their monitoring sources operators who manage these requirements by wrestling with complexity manu ally will de nitely welcome any respite that they can get from semiautomated unsupervised machine learning as highlighted in by 303 for ml to become pervasive in networking the semantic gapwhich refers to the key challenge of transferring ml results into actionable insights and reports for the network operatormust be overcome this can facilitate a shift from a reactive interaction style for network management where the network manager is expected to check maps and graphs when things go wrong to aproactive one where automated reports and noti cationsare created for different services and network regions ideally this would be abstract yet informative such as google maps directions eg there is heavier traf c than usual on your route as well as suggestions about possible actions this could be coupled with an automated correlation of different reports coming from different parts of the network this will require a move beyond mere noti cations and visualizations to more substantial synthesis through which potential sources of problems can be identi ed another example relates to making measurements more useroriented most users would be more interested in qoe instead of qos ie how the current condition of the network affects their applications and services rather than just raw qos metrics the development of measurement objectives should be from a businesseyeball perspectiveand not only through presenting statistics gath ered through various tools and protocols such as traceroute ping bgp etc with the burden of putting the various pieces of knowledge together being on the user b semisupervised learning for computer networks semisupervised learning lies between supervised and unsu pervised learning the idea behind semisupervised learning is to improve the learning ability by using unlabeled data incorporation with a small set of labeled examples in com puter networks semisupervised learning is partially used in anomaly detection and traf c classi cation and has great potential to be used with deep unsupervised learning archi tectures like generative adversarial networks for improving the state of the art in anomaly detection and traf c classi cation similarly user behavior learning for cybersecurity can also be tackled in a semisupervised fashion a semi supervised learning based anomaly detection approach is pre sented in 304 the presented approach used large amounts of unlabeled samples together with labeled samples to build a better intrusion detection classi er in particular a single hidden layer feedforward nn has trained to output a fuzzy membership vector the results show that using unla beled samples help signi cantly improve the classi ers performance in another work 305 have proposed semi supervised learning with 97 accuracy to lter out non malicious data in millions of queries that domain name service dns servers receive c transfer learning in computer networks transfer learning is an emerging ml technique in which knowledge learned from one problem is applied to a different but related problem 306 although it is often thought that for ml algorithms the training and future data must be in the same feature space and must have the same distribution this is not necessarily the case in many realworld applica tions in such cases it is desirable to have transfer learn ingor knowledge transfer between the different task domains transfer learning has been successfully applied in computer vision and nlp applications but its implementation for net working has not been witnessedeven though in principle this can be useful in networking as well due to

learning is a collaborative ml technique which does not make use of centralized training data and works by distributing the processing on different machines feder ated learning is considered to be the next big thing in cloud networks as they ensure the privacy of the user data and less computation on the cloud to reduce the cost and energy 308 system and method for network address management in the federated cloud are presented in 309 and the application of federated iot and cloud computing for health care is presented in 310 an endtoend security architecture for federated cloud and iot is presented in 311 e generative adversarial networks gans in computer networks adversarial networksbased on generative adversarial net work gan training originally proposed by goodfellow and colleagues at the university of montreal 312have recently emerged as a new technique using which machines can be trained to predict outcomes by only the observing the world without necessarily being provided labeled data an adversarial network has two nn models a generator which is responsible for generating some type of data from some random input and a discriminator which has the task of distinguishing between input from the generator or a real data set the two nns optimize themselves together resulting in a more realistic generation of data by the generator and a better sense of what is plausible in the real world for the discrimina tor reference 313 proposed a gan for generating malware examples to attack a malware classi er and then proposes a defense against it another adversarial perturbation attack on malware classi er is proposed in 314 the use of gans for ml in networking can improve the performance of mlbased networking applications such as anomaly detection in which malicious users have an incentive to adversarial craft new attacks to avoid detection by network managers v pitfalls and caveats of using unsupervised ml in networking with the bene ts and intriguing results of unsupervised learn ing there also exist many shortcomings that are not addressed widely in the literature some potential pitfalls and caveats related to unsupervised learning are discussed next a inappropriate technique selection to start with the rst potential pitfall could be the selection of technique different unsupervised learning and predicting techniques may have excellent results on some applications while performing poorly on othersit is important to choose the best technique for the task at hand another reason could be a poor selection of features or parameters on

decisions made by ml is especially important for the operational success of ml in largescale operational networks and its acceptance by operators net work managers and users but prediction accuracy and sim plicity are often in con ict 315 as an example the greater accuracy of nns accrues from its complex nature in which input variables are combined in a nonlinear fashion to build a complicated

academic research and practical applications of unsupervised learning in other elds we see that there is a dearth of prac tical applications of ml solutions in operational networks particular for applications such as network intrusion detec tion 303 which are challenging problems for a number of reasons including 1 the very high cost of errors 2 the lack of training data 3 the semantic gap between results and their operational interpretation 4 enormous variability in input data and nally 5 fundamental dif culties in conducting sound performance evaluations even for other applications the success of ml and its wide adoption in practical systems at scale lags the success of ml solutions in many other domains d ignoring simple nonmachinelearning based tools one should also keep in mind a common pitfall that aca demic researchers may suffer from which is not realizing that 2httpswwwdarpamilprogramexplainablearti cialintelligence volume 7 2019 65605m usama et al unsupervised machine learning for networking techniques applications and research challenges figure 8 intuitively we expect the ml models performance to improve with more data but to deteriorate in performance if the model becomes overly complex for the data figure adapted from 317 network operators may have simpler nonmachine learning based solutions that may work as well as naive mlbased solutions in practical settings failure to examine the ground realities of operational networks will undermine the effec tiveness of mlbased solutions we should expect mlbased solutions to augment and supplement rather than replace other nonmachinelearning based solutionsat least for the foreseeable future e overfitting another potential issue with unsupervised models is over t ting it corresponds to a model representing the noise or ran dom error rather than learning the actual pattern in data while commonly associated with supervised ml the prob lem of over tting lurks whenever we learn from data and thus is applicable to unsupervised ml as well as illustrated in figure 8 ideally speaking we expect ml algorithms to provide improved performance with more data but with increasing model complexity performance starts to deterio rate after a certain pointalthough it is possible to get poorer results empirically with increasing data when working with unoptimized outofthebox ml algorithms 317 according to the occam razor principle the model complexity should be commensurate with the amount of data available and with overly complex models the ability to predict and generalize diminishes two major reasons for over tting could be the overly large size of the learning model and fewer sample data used for training purposes generally data is divided into two portions actual data and stochastic noise due to the unavailability of labels or related information unsupervised learning model can over t the data which causes issues in testing and deployment phase crossvalidation regulariza tion and chisquared testing are highly recommended for designing or tweaking an unsupervised learning algorithm to avoid over tting 318 f data quality issues it should be noted that all ml is data dependent and the per formance of ml algorithms is affected largely by the nature volume quality and representation of data in the case of unsupervised ml data quality issues must be carefully con sidered since any problem with the data quality will seriouslymar the performance of ml algorithms a potential prob lem is that dataset may be imbalanced if the samples size from one class is very much smaller or larger than the other classes 319 in such imbalanced datasets the algorithm must be careful not to ignore the rare class by assuming it to be noise although imbalanced datasets are more of a nuisance for supervised learning techniques they may also pose problems for unsupervised and semisupervised learn ing techniques g inaccurate model building it is dif cult to build accurate and generic models since each model is optimized for certain kind of applications unsupervised ml models should be applied after carefully studying the application and the suitability of the algorithm in such settings 320 for example we highlight certain issues related to the unsupervised task of clustering 1 random initialization in kmeans is not recommended 2 number of clusters is not known before the clustering operation as we do not have labels 3 in the case of hierarchical clustering we do not know when to stop and this can cause increase in the time complexity of the process and 4 evaluating the clustering result is very tricky since the ground truth is mostly unknown h machine learning in adversarial environments many networking problems such as anomaly detection are adversarial problems in which the malicious intruder is con tinually trying to outwit the network administrators and the tools used by the network administrators in such settings machine learning that learns from historical data may not perform due to clever crafting of attacks speci cally for circumventing any schemes based on previous data due to these challenges pitfalls and weaknesses due care must be exercised while using unsupervised and semi supervised ml these pitfalls can be avoided in part by using various best practices 321 such as endtoend learning pipeline testing visualization of the learning algorithm regu larization proper feature engineering dropout sanity checks through human inspectionwhichever is appropriate for the problems context 65606 volume 7 2019m usama et al

are used to measure a fibers length endtoend loss location of optical loss and reflectivity of components along the fiber 4 otdr works on the principle of rayleigh backscattering the basic idea lies in transmitting a short pulse of light through a fiber and examining the time dependent response of the resulting backscattered signal a small part of injected light is captured by the core of the fiber and propagates backwards any change in the backscattered level along the fiber is due to a defect or an alteration in the properties of the fiber often called an event otdr measures the backscatter light as a function of time from the initial pulse injection performance metrics for comparing and contrasting various approaches in optical time domain reflectometery exists and primarily uses one way fiber attenuation range ldb which results in a reflectometer output snr of unity 1 as the users of optical fiber have migrated to longer transmission wavelengths because of lower loss and as higher quality fibers have become available there is literally less backscattered light to be measured 5 event detection and classification becomes tough for minute reflections in otdr signal processing as the rayleigh backscatter is about 45db lower than the launch power variety of techniques has been used to detect such weak signals a composite coding scheme for snr enhancement has been used for such weak signal detection and tested for our inhouse built otdr the notion lies in combining complementary correlation codes with the simplex codes to achieve higher gain than conventional coding techniques 67 research in the postprocessing algorithm for otdr revolves around the ways of improving the method of extracting the event information and features from the otdr signature in this paper an algorithm is presented for the detection of the discontinuities in otdr signature that will describe optical fiber attenuation characteristic buried in high level additive signal such

removed the logged trace rolls up when the backscatter reaches the noise floor it is necessary to remove the adc offset before post processing after the offset is removed the final trace needs to be analyzed for events and their parameters offset compensation is an important task in post processing of acquired traces as it ensures offset errors removed and a linear trace display b trace analysis the purpose of the trace analysis step is to find different reflective and nonreflective events along the fiber and to measure their locations and losses nonreflective events are of two types namely loss and gain for each nonreflective event the insertion loss is measured the accurate method of determining the nonreflective event is to find four marker locations two before the event and two after the event for each nonreflective event the insertion loss il needs to be measured the accurate method for determining the loss is to find four marker locations two before the event and two after the

the offset is not removed properly the logged trace rolls up or down when the backscatter reaches the noise floor level it is very important point in acquiring the final trace that offset must be

challenging task many approaches for defending against these attacks are available in the literature but these techniques are shown ineffective against newer variations of the attacks6the following are a few recommendations for designing a defensive inter vention against adversarial examples a generic defense that can defend against any type of adversarial attack is not possible so the first logical step is to understand the threat model of the system for which the defensive intervention is needed in many cases the adversarial examples are gen eratedsampled from a distribution similar to the legitimate data a preemptive data generation process by using generative models and aggres sive labeling labeling the preemptively generatedexamples as false positives can improve the odds of detecting many adversarial attacks in our previ ous work12we have shown that this procedure can help in making a better defense deploy all known procedures from the literature that is in line with the threat model always design defenses considering adaptive adversaries evaluating a defense in the following we have provided a few important evaluation guidelines for evaluating the mlbased 5g applications against adversarial ml attacks these insights are extracted from the carlini et al19and our previous works620 many defenses are available in the literature against adversarial attacks but these defenses are limited by the design of the application using them without considering the threat model of mlbased 5g applications can create a false sense of security so for mlbased 5g applications threat models must clearly state the assumptions taken type of the adversary and the metrics used for evaluating the defense always test the defense against the strongest known attack and use it as a baseline evaluating for an adaptive adversary is also necessary evaluate the defense procedure for gradient based gradientfree and random noisebased attacks httpswwwrobustmlorg clearly state the evaluation parameters accu racy recall precision f1 score receiver operat ing characteristic curve roc etc used in evaluatingvalidating the defense and always look for a change in the false

of research but are the ml models foolproof and robust to security attacks to be in charge of managing the network unfortunately many modern ml models are eas ily misled by simple and easilycrafted adversarial perturbations which does not bode well for the future of mlbased cognitive networks unless ml vulnerabilities for the cognitive networking envi ronment are identified addressed and fixed the purpose of this article is to highlight the problem of unsecure ml and to sensitize the readers to the danger of adversarial ml by showing how an eas ily crafted adversarial ml example can compro mise the operations of the cognitive selfdriving network in this article we demonstrate adversar ial attacks on two simple yet representative cog nitive networking applications namely intrusion detection and network traffic classification we also provide some guidelines to design secure ml models for cognitive networks that are robust to adversarial attacks on the ml pipeline of cognitive networks introduct ion the cognitive networking idea a recurring motif in networking research that has been expressed in various guises such as autonomic networking selforganized networking knowledgebased net working and most recently as selfdriving network ing 1 now this idea appears to be within grasp thanks to the tremendous strides made in the field of machine learning ml that have transformed the entire fields of vision language speech and information processing many proponents are optimistic that ml will play a central role in enabling the future selfdriving cognitive networks by comprehensively automating the cognitive net working tasks such as realtime telemetry network automation network intent modeling and net work decision making a broad illustration of the various tasks involved in the operations of cognitive selfdriving networks is provided in fig 1 many of these highlighted tasks require a datadriven learning and inference process hence they can benefit from using a ml pipeline involving methods such as deep super vised ml and reinforcement learning however despite the great promise and suc cess of ml methods the recent discovery of the susceptibility of ml models to security problems has dampened the optimism around the use of ml in cognitive networking the major reasons for the security vulnerabilities of ml models are the underlying implicit assumption that the train ing and test data are similar in distribution and that the test examples are benign and not adver sarial an adversarial example is defined as an imperceptible minor perturbation of the input that an adversary especially crafts to maximize the prediction error of the ml model 2 deep neural networks dnns in particular have been shown to be very vulnerable to such adversarial examples 3 it is worth noting that dnns are not the only ml models vulnerable to adversarial examples the problem is much broader and many other ml systems including reinforcementlearning rl and generative models 4 are also susceptible to adversarial examples adversarial ml is now a fastexpanding field attracting significant attention from the industry and academia 4 although ml vulnerabilities in domains such as vision image and audio are now well known relatively little attention has focused on adversarial attacks on cognitive networking ml models an illustration of the ml pipeline in cognitive selfdriving networks along with poten tial security attacks that may be launched on its components is depicted next in fig 2 due to the rising popularity of cognitive net working and selfdriving networks ml models used in the context of cognitive networks have become highprofile targets for malevolent adver saries who are interested in compromising the integrity and availability of these ml models the resulting threat becomes more serious when cog nitive networking breaks through into safetycrit ical networks such as selfdriving vehicles and vehicular networks internet of things smart city services and cyberphysical systems then it will no longer be only computer systems and their accessories that are at risk but the security of everything and everyone will be threatened the main contribution of this article is to high the adversarial machine learning conundrum can the insecurity of ml become the achilles heel of cognitive networks muhammad usama junaid

paginationieee network accepted for publication 2light the vulnerability of mlbased functionality in modern cognitive networks to adversarial attacks and to review the state of the art in the application of adversarial ml techniques in networking we also provide recommendations for developing robust ml models for selfdriving cognitive networks in this article we only consider the adversarial ml attacks on the network telemetry component of the cognitive selfdriving network as other cognitive selfdriving networking components rely on the data provided by this critical component any fault in the telemetry part will result in less efficient selfdriving networks since realtime telemetry uses supervised ml schemes we have chosen anomalybased intrusion detection and network traffic classification as case studies to highlight the adversarial ml threat on cognitive selfdriving networks adversarial ml attacks on other components of cognitive selfdriving networks which are mostly based on reinforcement learning are left as a future direction we also propose a concrete novel networkspecifi c adversarial ml attack on an anomalybased intrusion detection system and network traffic classification to highlight potential issues that may arise when adversarial ml attacks are launched on future mlbased cognitive selfdriving networks for cognitive networking to really take off it is extremely important that the underlying technology has to be robust to all kinds of potential problems be they accidental intentional or adversarial background in this section we discuss the challenges posed by adversarial ml attacks and then propose a taxonomy of adversarial ml attacks we will then survey the proposed adversarial attacks and defenses after that we highlight the stateoftheart in adversarial ml attacks on selfdriving cognitive networks to emphasize that this area of research needs special attention as networking moves from traditional networking to selfdriving cognitive networks challenges posed by adversarial ml a ttacks ml adds substantially to the worries of security practitioners by expanding an alreadybroad attack surface comprising standard but still potent attacks in addition the future denselyconnected iotera cognitive networking will likely expose new vulnerabilities and a wider attack surface through its emphasis on massive connectivity previous research has shown that a motivated wellresourced adversary can arbitrarily alter data and labels to compromise ml models completely and induce an error rate of up to 100 percent 5 another important reason for adversarial ml attacks is the lack of a better understanding of how modern ml frameworks such as dnns operate multiple explanations for the sensitivity of the ml models to adversarial examples have been provided in the literature 4 including the nonlinearity of the dnn models which can assign random labels in areas that are underexplored in the training set but such a hypothesis fails to explain the transferability 1 of adversarial examples from one ml model to another in addition it is not only the nonlinear dnn models that suffer from these attacks but linear models have also been shown to be vulnerable to adversarial examples 4 while the reasons for the capitulation of the ml models to adversarial examples are still not well known it is clear that these adversarial attacks pose a grave danger to the security of future cognitive networks which requires immediate attention from the community adversarial examples are especially challeng ing due to the asymmetric nature of adversarial ml attacks the asymmetry implies that the job of the defender is to secure the entire attack surface all the time but the attacker only has to fi nd a single kink in the surface the attacker also attacks surreptitiously much like in guerrilla warfare using previouslyunseen attacks at a time of its own choosing the attacker constructs these attacks creatively by adding adversarial noise to incur the worstcase domain shifts in the input in a bid to elicit incorrect results by the ml model this stacks the odds in favor of the attacker and the battle becomes a manifestly unfair one to prove that the ml model is secure against attacks the defender has to anticipate the threat models and provide formal proof that demonstrates the fortitude to withstand the assumed threats with the well known attacks proposed in the literature 5 the bar of eff ort required for launching new attacks has lowered since the same canned attacks can be used by others although sommer and paxson 6 were probably right in 2010 to downplay the potential of security attacks on ml saying exploiting the specifi cs of a machine learning implementation requires significant eff ort time and expertise on the attackers side the danger is real now when an attack can be launched on mlbased implementations with minimal eff ort time and expertise taxonomy of security attacks on machine learning in this section we aim to communicate the big picture of adversarial ml security by referring to the ml pipeline for cognitive networking fig 2 and a taxonomy of adversarial ml related issues that we developed fig 3 based on the attacks location on the ml pipe line security attacks on ml models can be classifi ed into two categories first in a poisoning or training attack the attacker can access and adversarially poison the training data in a bid to maximize the classification error attacks during the training phase can also include theft of the intellectual property ip if the training is outsourced figure 1 the cognitive selfdriving networking components and their related tasks are highlighted to provide the reader with a basic understanding of how cognitive selfdriving networks can be realized supervised and reinforcement learning techniques are expected to play a vital role in achieving most of the tasks real time telemetrydatadriv en analysis netw ork

magazine content is final as presented with the exception of paginationieee network accepted for publication 3to some external provider second in an evasion or inference attack on the other hand the attacks attempt to perturb the textinference input through the creation of adversarial examples to compromise the ml model the attacks can also attempt to steal the ml model ip through a side channel through successive polling other types of attacks may involve obtaining physical access and intrusion into the hardware based on the adversarys knowledge adver sarial ml attacks can be categorized into two types in a whitebox attack it is assumed that the adversary has perfect knowledge of the ml architecture trainingtesting data and the hyperparameters of the model in contrast in a blackbox attack it is considered that the adversary has partial access or no access to the deployed model based on the knowledgeaccess of the adversary blackbox attacks are further divided into two categories namely querybased attacks and zeroquery attacks a blackbox attack where an adversary can act as a standard user and query the ml model for a response and later use that queryresponse pair to generate an adversarial example is known as a querybased attack the zeroquery attack is defined as a blackbox attack where the adversary has no access to the deployed ml model but has only a few test samples available to craft adversarial examples against a deployed ml model based on the adversarial intent specifi city we can further divide evasion attacks into two classes in a targeted attack the attacker aims to fool the ml classifi er to classify all adversarial samples in one class by maximizing the probability of the targeted attack for example an adversary that wants to disguise the intrusive traffic as normal network traffi c can create a perturbation that maximizes the classifi cation probability of the normal traffic class in a nontargeted attack the attacker aims to fool the ml classifier by assigning an adversarial sample to any other class except the original one these attacks are performed by minimizing the probability of the original class that ensures that the adversarial sample will not get classifi ed in the original class all classifi cation schemes depicted in the tax onomy are directly related to the intentgoal of the adversary most of the existing adversarial ml attacks are whitebox attacks which are later converted to blackbox attacks by exploiting the transferability property of adversarial examples 7 the transferability property of adversarial ml means that adversarial perturbations generated for one ml model will often mislead other unseen ml models related research has been carried out on adversarial pattern recognition for more than a decade and even before that there was a smattering of works focused on performing ml in the presence of malicious errors 5 brief review of the adversarial ml l iterature adversarial ml attacks proposed in lit erature ml models especially those that are dnnbased are very vulnerable to adversarial perturbations an adversarial sample x is created by adding a small carefully crafted perturbation dto the correctly classifi ed sample x the perturba tion d is calculated by approximating the optimi zation problem given in equation 1 iteratively until the crafted adversarial example gets classifi ed by ml classifi er f in targeted class t xxarg min xfxt 1 in 2013 szegedy et al 7 reported that the dnn inputoutput mapping is fairly discontinuous and dnns are not robust to small perturbations in the input this triggered an extraordinary interest in adversarial ml attacks in 2014 goodfellow et al 8 proposed a nontargeted elementwise adversarial example generation method where the adversarial perturbation is generated by performing only a singlestep gradient update in the direction of the gradient at each element of the input example this method of generating adversarial ml attacks is called the fast gradient sign method fgsm kurakin et al 9 proposed the basic iterative method bim attack which improves the fgsm attack by introducing an iterative small perturbation

adversarial ml attack can be launched and to show that many cognitive network ing based ml applications in their current form may not provide any robustness against adversarial per turbations while our explicit focus is on ids and network traffic classification applications our insights apply more broadly to diverse supervised unsuper vised and reinforcement learning techniques we formulated the network anomalybased intrusion detection problem as a binary classifi cation problem where the classification is per formed between two classes namely normal or dos denial of services svm and dnn are employed for performing the classification task the reason for selecting svm and dnn to per form classification is to highlight the fact that both traditional and more recent ml techniques svm and dnn respectively are highly susceptible to small carefullycrafted adversarial examples for the network traffic classification we for mulated it as a multiclass classification problem where the classification is performed between ten network traffic classes namely www mail bulk serv db int p2p attack mmedia and games we employed svm and dnn for per forming the classification task thre at

researchers in other application domains have started to work on robustbydesign models and algorithms and we should have similar if not higher standards for cognitive networking applications there does not exist much work on guidelines for evaluating the defenses against adversarial ml attacks particularly against cognitive networks in the following we provide some guidelines leveraging the insights shared by carlini et al 10 on how to effectively evaluate the robustness of ml schemes check the adversarial threat model used in the defense under review for evaluating what kind of

defense under review provide robustness against gradientbased adversarial attacks evaluate the defense under consideration using different threat model assumptions and for different performance metrics evaluate the defense under consideration against strong adversarial attacks ie optimi zationbased attacks and not against weak attacks out of distribution adversarial exam ples transferable adversarial examples to check whether the transferability property of adversarial examples is blocked or not develop ing new metrics for ml in cogn itive networks traditionally the metric used to evaluate the per formance of an ml model nearly always has been a variant of the metric of prediction accuracy that is how often is the model correct in its prediction or classification to be sure accuracy can be mea sured in various ways such as precision specifici ty sensitivity recall but using accuracy alone as a metric can only inform us of the averagecase per formance this has the implicit assumption that the distribution of the test data will be similar to the dis tribution of the training data this assumption obvi ously fails to hold when an adversary intentionally changes the test data with the explicit goal of defeat ing the ml model there is therefore a need to also focus on evaluating a systems worst case perfor mance and measure the adversarial resilience of the ml model we should move away from only using traditional ml metrics related to accuracy and preci sion toward a greater emphasis on robustness trans parency and resilience here we recommend some new metrics for ensuring the appropriate applica tion and validation of ml schemes in selfdriving cognitive networking there can be more metrics depending on the design of the mlbased selfdriv ing cognitive networking application inference stability this is a measure that com pares the output of the victims model before and after the adversarial attack inference stability is calculated by measuring the distribution similar ity before and after the adversarial attack and defense divergence to the average is a popular way of computing the similarity between distri butions for selfdriving cognitive networks infer ence stability will provide information about the attack and recovery of the system from the adver sarial ml attack classification confidence variance this is a measure intended to demonstrate how the model is impacted by the adversarial attack and defensive technique more precisely classifica tion confidence variance provides the change in the confidence of the classification of an example after the adversarial attack and after the adversarial defense is applied misclassification ratio this is a measure intended for quantifying the success of an adver sarial attack it gives a measure of how many adversarial examples have successfully evaded the classifier it is also an important measure from the defenders perspective as the misclassification ratio provides a quantitative measure for testing the defense against adversarial attacks semantic insights despite its success in other domains ml has traditionally not been as successful in terms of deployments in the real world for detecting anomalies one important reason behind this is that for anomaly detection semantic knowledge under lying the prediction and not only the prediction itself is important for operational networks as there is a need to also focus on evaluating a systems worst case performance and measure the adver sarial resilience of the ml model we should move away from only

adversarial examples on the mlbased realtime network telem etry component of selfdriving cognitive networks realtime network telemetry consists of supervised ml and feature engineering but there are

selfdriving cognitive networks unfortunately drl also lacks robustness against adversarial examples and it has been recently shown 5 that adversarial examples can affect the performance of drl the threat of adversarial examples and brittleness of the known defenses is one of the major hurdles in the progress of cognitive selfdriving networks conclus ions in this article we introduced the

sources such as agricultural areas fireplaces construction processes in cities heating and cooling units in the buildings are categorized as area sources of urban air pollution the pollutants from area sources result in particulate matter and other criteria pollutants household emissions also contribute to the degradation of air quality processes like biomass combustion fossil fuel burning such as coal diesel kerosene oil etc tobacco smoking and cen tral air conditioning are a few important sources of household emissions household emissions create different criteria and biological pollutants since this paper only considers ambient air pollution indoor air pollution sources are out of the scope of this work we also want to note here that multiple sources from diverse surroundings contribute to urban air pollution which varies depending on the geographical location of the pollution sources in the city wind direction and speed humidity and other meteorological conditions and so

with the discussions of air quality mod eling and measurement it is imperative to examine the current global air quality landscape by gleaning insights from various studies on the impact of air pollution and mitigation initiatives undertaken in various parts of the world the air quality life index aqli 49 report released in july 2020 suggests that air pollution was the most prominent risk to human health before the pandemic covid19 and after it as well 50 many countries are now putting a lot of effort into designing policies for reducing emissions albeit the progress is slow and many countries are still struggling to cope with the air quality issue in this section we examine the air quality landscapes particulate air pollution of various countries as well as air pollution and the policies used by these countries to address air pollution challenges 31 asia 311 china china is the most populated country in the world it is home to 1847 of the total population of the world 61 of its population lives in cities in 2013 the concentration of the pm25in beijing city was so high that it seemed that the city will become uninhabitable 51 at the time an average person in the beijing city was exposed to approximately 91 gm3of pm 25air pollution it is nine times higher than the who recommended value for pm 25 in january 2014 the situation got even worse when the pm 25concentration went 35 to 40 times higher than the who recommended value and the city officials warned people to stay indoors 52 the guardian describes it as beijings airpocalypse similarly in shanghai the air pollution went beyond the critical level there the recorded pm 25concentration was six times more than the who recommended value given the situation in 2014 the chines government released a national air quality action plan worth 270 billion 9 httpsappcpcbccrcomccr docsfinalreport aqi pdf 10 httpsaqicnorgscaleusd with the sole purpose of bringing the air pollution down the plan has three goals 1 reduce the pm 10by 10 relative to its value in 2012 2 reduce the pm 25by 25 in beijingtianjinhebei by 20 in the pearl river delta and by 15 in the yangtze river delta 3 reduce annual pm 25of beijing to 60 gm3 the national air quality action plan worked for china by 2017 the pm 25concentration in beijingtianjinhebei went down by 36 in pearl and yangtze delta the air pollution went down by 27 and 34 respectively this success was achieved due to a collaborative effort from different government entities in reducing the dependency on coal controlling car emissions increasing renewable energy enforcing emission policies reducing steel and plastic manufacturing and replacing coal boilers with natural gas or electric heaters 53 though these steps have improved the air quality in china the war against air pollution is not over as longterm solutions for bringing air pollution down to the whos recommended values are needed 312 india india is the 2nd most populated country in the world

dispersion models formulate and simulate the dispersion of the pollutants emitted by different sources the simulation provides an estimation of the downward air pollutant concentration dispersion models are used to predict the concentration for specific scenarios such as the change of the pollution source these models are more suited for pollutants that react in the environment and spread over large distances the models are also widely used by regulatory bodies during the preparation and evaluation of air permit applications public safety and emergency response personals utilize these

trajectory caused by the mountainous terrain it is capable of simulating the flow anddistortions in the plume near predefined three dimensional 3d terrain features while remaining simple by applying flowdistortion adjustments to flatterrain gaussian and bigaussian pollution distributions 121 122 the ctdmplus requires a significant amount of information on the topography and weather to produce an

the historical data of the criteria pollutants cmaq is used to simulate and estimate the performance of epa missions for understanding and forecasting air pollution human exposure to air pollution watershed acidification 126 deposition of nitrogen and sulfur 127 and many other air pollutionrelated use cases three common types of cmaq are wrfcmaq wong et al 128 proposed a combination of weather research and fore casting with the inputs of the cmaq eg aerosol concentration to introduce the effect of the chemistry into the weather this coupled design meteorology from cmaq and the chemistry from weather research and fore casting component is known as wrfcmaq information from cmaq such as aerosol concentration is transmitted into wrf so that the chemistry can influence the weather more details on the wrfcmaq are available in 128 cmaqddm cmaq decoupled direct method cmaqddm offers concentrations and deposition sensitivity statistics for user specified parameters 129 the motivation for cmaqddm comes from the desire to mea sure the concentrations of the pollutants by changing one or a few parameters out of many predefined air quality model parameters 130 air quality models usually take emissions as input and predict their concentrations cmaq ddm provides the ability to the policymakers to look at the pollution landscape by tweaking the parameters of interest or emission sources eg wildfires vehicles etc more details on the cmaqddm are available in 129 131 cmaqisam cmaq integrated source ap portionment method cmaqisam is a vari ant of cmaq that measures the attribution of the source in the overall value of the pollutant concentrations predictedoutputted by the air quality models for example identifying the proportion of the smog created by the stubble burning in a neighboring city this can be achieved by running the cmaq twice first with all emission use cases and second by removing the source of interest but this will be complex and computationally expensive cmaqisam this issue by calculating source attribution of many sources directly by the model in one simulation simon et al 132 used cmaqisam for characterizing co and nitrogen oxides sources in the baltimore area kwok et al 133 used cmaqisam to un derstand the pm 25sources and their effects 15 httpsgithubcomusepacmaqon the air quality more details on the cmaq isam are

criteria pollu tants for a large scale city state country continent level it takes emissions meteorology data land use surface topography initial and boundary conditions and chemistryrelated values as input and performs source attribution sensitivity and process analyses estes et al 134 used camx to model the exceptional air quality events in near realtime in taxes to estimate the ozone impact in

a regional scale modeling system that can simulate the physical and the reactive processes in the environment to show the effects of the spatiotemporal changes in the air pollutant concentration on the overall ambient air quality 4 urban airshed model variable grid uamv in the early 1970s the most commonly used air mod eling system was uamv photochemical modeling system18 uamv was widely used for air quality studies focused on ozone it is a 3d photochemical grid model that can model the effects of the chemical and physical processes in the environment on the concentrations of air pollutants uamv also pro vided a spatiotemporal distribution of the emissions of various air pollutants uamv is outdated and no longer used for air quality modeling 423 receptor modelling the third category of the air quality models is called receptor models these models are mathematical techniques for recognizing and quantifying the origins of air pollution at a particular receptor location 137 receptor models are different from dispersion and photochemical air quality models they do not require meteorological chemical and emission data to estimate the participation of the pollution sources in the air pollution concentrations at the receptor the receptor model uses the chemical and inert properties of gases so 2 co etc and the particulate matter particles to determine to contributions of the emission sources in the pollution concentrations at the receptor 138 139 1 chemical mass balance cmb the cmb 140 is a model for estimating the contribution of the emission sources to air pollution at the receptor locations cmb uses spatial ambient data and information 16 httpswwwcamxcom 17 httpremsadicfconsultingcom 18 httpuamvicfconsultingcompreprints wwwpreprintsorg not peerreviewed posted 26 april 2022 doi1020944preprints2022040232v114 about the pollution sources to determine the source contributions cmb quantifies the contributions at the receptor based on the distinct source types rather than individual emission sources a drawback of cmb is its inability to distinguish between emis sion sources with the same chemical and physical properties more details on the cmb are available in 140 2 unmix unmix19model uses a formulabased on a form of factor analysis to determine the chemical species in the air and their sources it does not take the chemical profile of the pollution sources as input instead it generates the chemical profile to estimate the number of pollution sources their syntheses and their participation in the air pollution at the receptor location 3 positive matrix factorization pmf pmf 141 is another air quality model which takes different features from sediments wet deposition surface water ambient air indoor air etc to identify the species of air pollutants pmf also determines the contributions of the pollution sources at the receptor the us epa no longer updates pmf and it no longer supports newer operating systems 43 air quality measuring sensors the air quality sensors are the most crucial component of any air quality monitoring network these sensors are used to determine the concentration of pollutants in the air typically these sensors are built with a lego connection for the data acquisition card and data telemetry is accomplished using wifi or cellular communication in practice data processing is done on the cloud rather than on the sensor however there have been a few situations where data is preprocessed on the air quality sensors specifications of air quality sensors are broadly given by the following parameters 1 accuracy this is a measure of how close the read ings of sensors would be as compared to the actual pollutant value 2 precision this is a measure of how well the sensor reproduces the same reading a sensor with low precision can give different readings at different times with the same pollutant level 3 range and detection limitations this is the mea sure of range of pollutant concentration that the sensor is able to detect correctly sensor performance may vary with different concentration of pollutant 4 copollutant interference cross interference from other pollutants also affect sensor readings it is intended to minimize the copollutant interference when measuring a certain pollutant 5 environmental interference sensor performance may vary under different environmental conditions such as low and high temperature humidity sun light etc 6 noise noise is the source of inaccuracy in sensor readings the effect of noise should be minimized to produce more precise and accurate sensor readings 19httpswwwepagovairresearch unmix60modelenvironmentaldataanalyses7 signal drift this is the drift in readings which occurs due to inherent sensor measurement methods and degradation of sensors components many air quality sensors suffer from signal drift when selecting a sensor it should be ensured that the drift can either be handled or it does not affect the readings to a significant level 8 response time different sensors can produce read ings with different minimum time intervals it should be ensured that the selected sensor is able to produce readings with acceptable time intervals 9 multisite measurement performance this is an in dicator that generalizes the copollutant interference and the environmental interference of sensor 431 measurement techniques a summary of the types of sensors and measurement techniques has been show in figure 4 particulate matter measurement of particulate mat ter concentration is broadly categorized in three methods gravimetric microbalance and optical mea surements whalley et al 142 gravimetric method is widely used by regulatory and certification au thorities it is based on weight difference of a filter medium before and after the gas is passed through the filter microbalance method uses the change in resonant frequency to measure the particulate matter concentration by far the most popular choice for measurement commercial realtime particulate matter sensors is the optical method scattering or absorption of a light beam is measured to determine the concentration of particulate matter gases the two major sensor types used for sensing gaseous pollutants are electrochemical sensor 143 and metal oxide sensors metal oxide sensors typi cally require more power to heat up to very high temperatures to enable significant sensitivity to target detection gas that also increases the start up time of sensor electrochemical sensors require less power to operate and thus allow for fast startup time and cost savings generated over life time of sensor20 432 sensing solutions oem sensors oem sensors comprise of just the sensing element further interfacing and signal con ditioning is required to convert the sensor output to meaningful numbers these sensors are popular choice for original equipment manufacturers sensing systems sensing systems are built upon the oem sensors and the output is provided in digital format sensing systems are available for both indoor and outdoor air quality monitoring apart from digital output many sensors are also available with extra features such as wifi or cellular connectivity and mobile application to view the sensor outputs as well as the resulting air quality index for many commercial and indoor air quality measurement

urban air project sought to infer air quality in areas where air quality stations were not available 146 it is a difficult undertaking since accessible air quality data is sparse and limited to tackle this challenge zheng et al 146 gathered context data from a range of additional sources meteorology road networks traffic flow poi and human mobility that have an indirect impact on air quality after acquiring the context data it is fused with sparse aqi data from known locations then spatial and temporal classifiers are used for inferring the aqi values at unknown places the spatial classifier is an artificial neural network ann that takes a subset of data and tries predicting aqi for unknown nodes by using pearson correlation of known features between nodes the temporal classifier takes the timedependent factors and tries predicting aqi for unknown nodes using a linearchain conditional random field crf the training is performed by iteratively adding unknown nodes to the set of known nodes that are classified confidently by the models for inferring aqi value at some unknown locationgrid features are applied to each classifier independently only those aqi values are reported where both classifiers have higher confidence results of the experiment are compared with different interpolation techniques like linear gaussian classical dispersion model decision tree crf and ann the initial step of urban air only inferred pm 10andno 2values for beijing and shanghai in subsequent work zheng et al 147 combined the spatiotemporal model with a realtime feature extraction database to make userfriendly web and mobile applications 512 forecasting air quality at each station following the successful inference of aqi values at arbitrary sites the next phase in the urban air project was to forecast aqi values at specific station locations 148 forecasting aqi values is critical because it allows policymakers to better un derstand air pollution trends and develop preventative and mitigation policies the method of estimating the next aqi value at a certain time granularity based on prior aqi values is known as aqi forecasting various connected aspects such as meteorology wind speeds temperature and so on might have an impact on the forecasting process therefore a realtime database is utilized to give meteorological datahumidity temperature and wind speed as well as weather forecasts and aqi values for each station site the forecasting component of the urban air project gathers data from 2296 stations in 302 chinese cities with each instance having concentrations of six air pollutants no 2so2o3copm 25 andpm 10 zheng et al 148 employed the four predictors listed below to forecast the aqi value at a station a temporal predictor is used to anticipate the aqi value using a linear regression model on the data a spatial predictor is used to provide the surrounding context to a neural network which forecasts an aqi value based on the context data a prediction aggregator trains a regression tree to give various weights to the first two predictions under different scenarios finally an inflection predictor is employed to simulate any rapid changes in aqi values and is only utilized in exceptional cases rain etc for the first 16 hours the aqi value after each hour is predicted while for the next 712h 1324h and 2548h a minmax range of aqi is forecasted zheng et al

regression tree rt all 513 deployment of air quality monitoring stations the placement of air quality sensors in suitable places is critical for obtaining relevant air quality data hsieh et al 74 solve the sensor placement problem with a restricted budget in the urban air project hsieh et al 74 used a two stage technique to handle this problem the first phase is to infer the air quality at an unknown place and the second is to pick candidate locations depending on the confidence of the inference the city of beijing has split into 1km x 1km patches for inference with each patch referred to as a node by linking these nodes with known and unknown aqi values a network is formed some of the linkages are made with the help of historical geographical and environmental factors local meteorology road network data and pois are used to provide weight to edges once the graph is complete an unknown aqi value is calculated using a weighted sum of aqi values from known modes instead of only obtaining a single value for aqi a distribution is learnt at each unknown node the weights of the graph are modified over numerous rounds to get a better distribution minimize entropy loss for recommending the locations of the station first find the node with the best distribution or lower entropy loss and rank it the last in the list after assigning a rank to this node label it as a known node and again run the inferring algorithm to find new inference after this find the node with the best distribution and assign it second last this step is repeated until all nodes are ranked 514

fixed location the crowd centric data collection is also divided into two categories activedata generated via participatory surveys and check ins or passive data generated by users passively while using the urban infrastructure gathering air quality and related data via these two paradigms is difficult because of the following challenges in static sensorcentric air quality data collection sensors are deployed at a fixed location and they communicate at a predefined frequency to the cen tral database ie cloud server this static sensor deployment makes the air quality measurement a resource constraint system limited budget land use workforce for maintaining the system etc as a result data gathered from very few sensors fixed at different locations in an urban environment is sparse and not sufficient representative of the air quality situation of the city in static sensorcentric air quality data collection where the number of sensors is limited the optimal placement of the air quality sensors for gathering representative enough data becomes a challenge though mobile sensorcentric data collection help resolve the issues faced in air quality data gathering due to the fixed nature of the static sensorcentric approach it has its challenges the air quality data gathered from the sensors mounted on moving objects such as buses bikes taxis uavs etc is skewed by the movement of these moving objects for example buses are usually used as a means of the commute from a busy fixed route the gathered data will provide a good representation of the air quality along the buss route but it will not provide a true depiction of urban air quality another challenge in mobile sensorcentric air quality data is the redundancy in the collected data since the sensorsmounted vehicle will be following a route es pecially buses the data collected will be redundant and the data from less traversed routes will be sparse it will result in an imbalanced data distribution any deduction made from the distribution will be biased towards the most frequent route human as a sensor is another way of getting the data for inferring the air quality data generated by the citizens passively while accessing the urban infrastructure call data record public wifi passenger bus card swipes taxi pick and drop locations etc is useful in determining the context of urban pollution here the key challenges are the privacy of the users the security of the service providers and meeting the legal requirements of data protection participatory crowdsensing is a procedure opted for gathering the context data used for inferring the urban air quality where the measurement campaigns and surveys are used to collect the data imbalance data coverage unavailability of ground truth to measure the quality of the collected air quality data and noisy and fake data reporting are a few challengesassociated with the participatory crowdsensing for air qualityrelated data to overcome these challenges in air quality data collection along with its proper context requires a great deal of planning and understanding of the urban environment selecting the right kind of sensors an acceptable level of measurement granularity designing a proper measurement campaign choosing the appropriate clouddatabase and ensuring the quality of the collected air pollution data and the motivation to make it public can help develop a comprehensive air quality dataset for determining the correct air quality values nevertheless a hybrid approach combining sensorcentric expertintheloop data collection techniques can yield better air quality data collection 62 air quality monitoring networks in underdeveloped countries the air quality situation in underdeveloped nations is dire yet they are unable to address it due to a lack of air quality monitoring networks deploying these networks across the country necessitates large sums of money and planning that in many underdeveloped countries is not available without an adequate and extensive air quality monitoring network in place economically developing nations are unable to gather air quality data and as a result lack policies for monitoring and combating air pollution trends lowcost air quality monitoring stations are used instead of actual weather stations and deployed in a few countries developing a countrywide lowcost air quality sensorsbased network remains a very challenging task 63 tradeoff between economic growth and air pollu tion the tradeoff between economic growth and air pollution im plies that economic expansion is connected to industrializa tion and transportation which necessitates the combustion of gasoline and other energy sources resulting in air pollution finding the right balance between economic growth and air pollution is a daunting task for many countries other variables such as population urban density and urban planning exacerbate the difficulty of this task 64 regularization and air quality measurements even though there are several environmental regulatory bodies and a plethora of regulatory rules but we continue to see that air quality in urban areas is becoming a predicament the implementation of these standards is an issue that many governments are unable to address for a variety of reasons including a lack of education financial resources political and religious divisions lack of global and regional cooperation and so on 210 65 urban planning and air quality urban planning plays a vital role in improving the air quality of the city unfortunately many metropolitans around the world are suffering from the worst air quality due to exponential growth in population traffic congestions high built densities and lack of urban planning canyon street thepreprints

designing robust and efficient systems for various applications it usually involves noise suppression silence removal and channel equalisation etc the performance of speechbased systems can be improved with the use of these preprocessing techniques 15 16 it has been also validated that removing silence pauses and noise even helpsmldl models in achieving better performance 17 in the case of speech synthesis text processing is even more complex it involves text normalisation tokenisation sentence segmentation etc 18 it is equally important in speech synthesis to improve system performance b feature extraction the representation of speech signals into meaningful in formative and a reasonably limited number of features is a crucial component for developing any system for speechbased applications despite the fact that there is no unique taxonomy of speech features it is common to divide features into two types ie linguistic and acoustic features the extraction procedures for these two types of features are significantly different and their performance greatly depends upon the type of problem at hand linguistic features represent information in spoken words this usually includes specific words their grammatical al terations or higher semantic and pragmatic markers 19 a variety of techniques exists for the analysis of speech using linguistic features for example keyword spotting aims at the reliable detection of a particular word in a given speech 20 21 these words are chosen from daily life and considered sufficient to represent the speakers states and related events acoustic features are very popular and widely being used these features are primarily extracted using the models of the human auditory system human hearingrelated properties such as lower sensitivity at lower frequencies spectral amplitude compression nonlinear frequency scale and large spectral integration are also considered in acoustic features 22 ongoing research on speech analysis has categorised the acoustic features into three categories prosodic spectral and temporal and features related to the voice quality 23 24 prosody refers to melody and rhythm of speech and prosodic features include the feature related to the length tone accent stress intonation and few others 25 26 these features can be used to detect the irregularities in the rhythm and timing of speech for instance nonverbal speech cues such as interruptions natural turns counting the number of interjections and response times can help to identify irregular speech patterns 27 in contrast to temporal features spectral features are authorized licensed use limited to university of exeter downloaded on july 172020 at 125610 utc from ieee xplore restrictions apply c 2020 ieee personal use is permitted

suffering and highly prevalent in patients with a chronic disease like cancer 77 despite the fact that psychological disorders can cause serious consequences routine screening has not been widely adopted in healthcare due to heavy cost and time requirements 78 recent studies have shown the promise of using speech as an effective biomarker for the diagnosis of psychological disorders spoken speech can provide a wide range of acoustic features that can be effectively utilised for human emotion detection 53 79 and diagnosis and monitoring of depression anxiety stress distress and suicidal behaviour 76 stateof theart deep learning models have improved the performance of emotion recognition depression anxiety stress distress and suicidal behaviour detection using speech 80 81 particularly the combination of cnns and lstm has shown great performance in modelling affective behaviours and related disorders from speech 82 83 here cnn is mainly used to extract temporal features and contextual modelling is performed using lstm cnns are also being employed in an endto end fashion to extract features from raw speech related to the problem at hand eg depression detection 84 convolutional layer in cnns acts a datadriven filterbank that can produce more generalised features compared to the standard artificial neural networks anns and other featurebased approaches 33 in this way deep learning models are playing an importantrole in modelling as well as diagnosis of different psychological disorder using speech signal this demonstrates that the speech technology has great potentials to automate the screening and monitoring of mental illnesses and related disorders hence alleviating many healthcare challenges d home and elder care life expectancy is greatly increasing worldwide which is causing a higher number of older people in our society 5 the increased share of the elderly population is shifting the cause of death from parasitic and infectious diseases to chronic illnesses 85 86 ageing also causes physical limitations that need to be compensated by the assistance of someone or with the services of aged care centres elderly people feel isolation fear and a sense of helplessness both inhome and at oldage care centres which cause severe consequences on both physical and mental health speechbased assistants are a valuable tool for seniors staying at home or age care centres especially for those who are not able to use other technologybased services that may require the dexterity of the hands mobility andor good vision such systems can also provide them with independence and a better quality of life with physical or cognitive disease 76 eaccess to healthcare services particularly in developing countries millions of

have poor literacy skills ie reading writing it has been shown that people with low health literacy have a onein three chance of misunderstanding the prescribed medication 87 there is a direct correlation between mortality rates and poor health literacy approximately 50 to 80 increased mortality risk for individuals with poor health literacy 88 language diversity is another challenge in developing countries that reduces the potential benefits of healthcare services such as text messaging and ehealth portals 89 such healthcare services are also not much useful for lowliterates the blind the visually impaired and those that are not computer literate speech is a plausible interaction modality for illiterate users and speechbased healthcare services can be ideal for inhabitants of the developing countries iv s peech for healthcare state oftheart a automatic speechrecognition asr automatic speech recognition asr is the analogue of machine ear which enables a computer to recognise uttered speech and transform it into the corresponding sequence of words or subwords asr has witnessed a steady improvement in performance due to the development of cuttingedge ml algorithms traditionally hmm and gmm based models were the main stock of research for asr dnnbased asr systems have become the stateoftheart by showing huge improvements compared to previous conventional system 90 developing and training asr systems however is complicated and requires a lot of preprocessing various attempts have been made to reduce the complexity of asr paving the way for endtoend speech recognition 91 nowadays endto end asr systems are extensively used and studied for asr in different languages such as english mandarin japanese or french 92 similarly sequencetosequence models are also gaining popularity in the automatic speech recognition asr community 91 various sequencetosequence models including recurrent neural network transducer rnnt 93 neural transducer 94 listen attend and spell las 95 recurrent neural aligner rna 96 and monotonic alignments 97 have been explored in the literature in addition transformers 98 based models are also gaining success in asr field due to their better performance we presented the performance comparison of different stateof theart models in terms of worderrorrate wer in table ii these systems demonstrate promising results on different datasets which shows the feasibility of their integration into healthcare applications a major application of asr in healthcare is to facilitate the generation of clinical documentations 9 the medical errors caused by bad handwriting can be avoided using speech recognition for medical documentations 108 such selftyping systems are also believed to enhance documentation quality and efficiency as well as improve the satisfaction level of health professionals in clinics or hospitals 71 different research studies explored the feasibility of asr systems for clinical documentation for instance in 109 authors evaluated a webbased asr system in a university hospital for clinical documentation in the german language they found that medical documentation with asr increasesin documentation speed and amount and it also has a positive impact on participant mood in contrast to selftyping hodgson et al 110 explored the use of asr for medical transcription of the doctorpatient conversation they used 14000 hours of speech and demonstrated that the proposed models achieved promising results on important medical utterances and therefore can be used practically in a clinical setting for transcribing medical conversations in 111 authors performed a case study in a specialised outpatient department and found that asr software supports medical doctors by quickly producing patient discharge letters without impairing user satisfaction the efficiency of speech recognition is evaluated by hoyt et al 112 for documenting outpatient encounters in the ehr system at a military hospital and its 12 outlying clinics seventy five clinicians participated to evaluate speech recognition for clinical documentation among these participants 69 of the clinicians continued to use speech recognition in their routine practices and reported that speech recognition for clinical documentation is more convenient accurate and expeditious for instance speech recognition helped in improving note quality and allowed for closing a patient encounter on the same day similarly authors in 113 showed that medical speech recognition can perform on a par with humans authors in 114 developed a webbased prototype to generate medical reports in the brazilian portuguese language using google web speech api and microsoft bing speech api they found that a system based on google api achieved an error rate of 1230 which was significantly better than those achieved by the microsoft api 1768 few other studies 115118 also highlighted the potential of using asr for clinical documentation all of these studies highlight several benefits of using asr for clinical documentation however most of these studies are pilot projects although the use of asr can drive interactive clinical documentation however careful evaluation is required for ehr 119 there is still a need to improve the efficiency of asr for medical documentation to avoid errors that have the potential to cause clinical harms furthermore improved system interoperability and workflow are needed for their successful integration in the clinical setting 120 b speech biomarkers human voice incorporates features that can plausibly be used to discriminate on the basis of gender age intelligence socioeconomic status regionalethnic origin education and occupation 14 most importantly for health outcomes it provides information about various voice disorders which can be diagnosed by detecting anomalous voice quality pitch and loudness that is inappropriate for an individuals age gender cultural background or geographic location 121 other speech related disorders include cognitivecommunication disorders communication disorders swallowing disorders and an autism spectrum disorder speech technologybased solutions have been playing an important role in the diagnostic and monitoring of these disorders nowadays dl models have become the stateoftheart technique in this domain automatic detection of vocal fold pathologies is of great interest to the voice community as well as the medical community due to its low cost and noninvasive nature these systems can be used by clinicians to detect the existence

and showed that cnn can effectively extract features from spectrograms of voice recordings suitable for diagnosing of voice disorders harar et al 124 conducted a preliminary study on voice pathology using dnns and showed that the use of combined cnnlstm provides promising results in 125 the authors investigated a voice pathology detection system using dl on a mobile multimedia healthcare system and voices samples captured using mobile devices more specifically the authors used a cnn architecture and reported significantly improved results in other work some researchers 126 127 designed voice pathology detection systems for smart cities but their work used classical ml models in their architectures acoustic analysis of speech is also used for the diagnosis of alzheimers disease which is cognitive impairment and the most common cause of dementia it has a high prevalence that is increasing rapidly towards an epidemic level the research community is trying to utilise speech technology to solve this issue in 128 lopezdeipina et al proposed a nonlinear multitask approach using a multilayer perceptron mlp and cnns for alzheimers detection the authors evaluated the proposed models using different speech features and reported promising results in 129 fraser et al explored the use of linguistic features for the identification of alzheimers they achieved stateoftheart results and found that linguistic analysis using modern ml is increasingly useful in assessment and clustering of alzheimers speech analysis is also being utilised for parkinsons disease pd detection for instance authors in 130 designed to diagnosis pd using speech signal they used dbns for classi fication and achieved significantly improved results attesting the power of dbn for speech analysis frid et al 131 used raw speech for pd detection using cnns they found that relatively small 20ms of raw speech contains much information regarding the pd that can be used for classification speech technology is also being used for the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder asd in children different studies used dl and speech signals for asd detection 132 133 also to assist children with asd 134 human speech

behaviour prediction of cancerafflicted patients is performed using different speech features they showed that speech can effectively be utilised for behavioural prediction in cancer patients various other studies 138140 utilised speech feature for identification stress anxiety and depression in english and also in other languages most of the abovementioned studies have used publicly available datasets and showed that speech technology can be effectively utilised as biomarkers for the detection of various diseases however these systems have not been evaluated in reallife settings it is important for researchers to focus on the design of systems that can be utilised in clinics and medical hospitals and on reporting reallife performance evaluations c remote monitoring the rising burden on the global healthcare system along with the limited availability of trained healthcare professionals is increasing the demand for infrastructure and technology that can facilitate the remote monitoring of patients speech technology based remote monitoring services have been explored in this regard by the research community in 141 hossain used speech along with and facial expressions which are captured in a multisensory environment the author tested the proposed framework on 100 people and was able to detect the patients state with an average recognition of 982 in another work vatanparvar et al 142 designed a speech privacy preservation method for speechbased remote health monitoring using gan and reported promising results a remote system for monitoring of speechlanguage intervention is proposed in 143 for the parents of children with asd for remote monitoring and assessment of cognitive function in senior people a system was proposed by rapcan et al in 144 the authors used telephone speech recordings and showed that the system can achieve similar results compared to speech recorded in a controlled environment the sweethome project was proposed in 145 which used noiserobust multisource asr to detect distressed sentences in a realistic environment of a smart home to monitor distress situations various studies also have proposed speech remote monitoring systems by exploiting the advanced communication technolo gies a 5g enabled emotionaware healthcare framework was proposed in 146 the authors evaluated the proposed healthcare framework on 50

asked to express the emotion of pain they used both speech and video as the input of the system and achieved 9995 of accuracy a privacyenhanced emotion recognition system for remote advisory is presented in 147 the authors showed that the proposed system can solve privacy issues while achieving promising results similarly an edgecloud based privacypreserving automatic emotion recognition system is proposed which use both speech and visual features 148 they used cnns for emotion classification and achieved improved results compared to the stateoftheart systems some other studies 149151 have also used speech signal for remote patients monitoring however most of these studies evaluated the proposed models in a controlled setup therefore to ensure a safe and robust operation it is very important to evaluate these systems in reallife settings d speech synthesis speech synthesis also known as texttospeech tts is an important technology that aims to convert text into speech most of the tts systems use acoustic or linguistic features as an intermediate representation to generate the waveform traditionally the speech waveform was vocoded from these intermediate representation using

model that can generate relatively realistic humanlike speech by using linguistic features it has the downside of a long inference time due to its autoregressive architecture to address this issue various models such as fftnet 156 wavernn 157 and waveglow 158 have been proposed nowadays these neural vocoders have replaced the use of traditional heuristic methods and can dramatically enhance the quality of generated speech researchers are also focusing on synthesising more natural speech by transferring prosody 159 style 160 and expressions 161 all these studies have highlighted the great

of bettering patient care through the use of assistive and digital tools it can further enhance digital health technology by speechbased health apps websites and emergency call systems etc patients can be verbally reminded about important alerts using tts which increases the usability and accessibility of portable health trackers 167 different studies evaluated the feasibility of tts assistive healthcare system for instanceliu et al 168 designed a smartphonebased system to help visually impaired people while using android phones in 169 the authors presented a design of a ttsbased interactive medication reminder and tracking system for wrist devices they evaluated the system for both native and nonnative english speakers in controlled experiments and achieved very promising results a voice interactive assistant was designed in 170 to improve adherence to medical treatments the authors designed this system for stroke patients and tested among several healthy subjects for an initial assessment however the final product was reported to be still under development tts health assistive tools can dramatically improve people health and required costs for example a ttsbased system can facilitate patients by offering them an audio version of digital text 171 172 this is especially helpful for illiterate individuals language learners and the elderly population and people with learning disabilities or reduced vision such systems can also help people by providing an audio version of important medical information such as descriptions of diseases prescriptions and drug information leaflets this avoids drug misuse while making patients cautious about their health 173 ttsbased systems also allow patients to accurately communicate their needs which helps to establish a cognitive connection among doctors and patients 174 e some healthcare solution using speech technology as outlined above speech technology finds its market in healthcare particularly due to potential and impactful use cases various voiceenabled healthcare solutions are developed that can help improve the lives of thousands of individuals we presented the details of some prominent solutions in table iv these solutions are being used by both doctors and patients to change the traditional setting of health provision the development of speechbased solutions is continuously growing that will significantly impact the current healthcare system in the next several years v s peech forhealthcare challenges despite the promising potentials of speech technology in the health domain there are various hurdles in largescale deployment of speechenabled solutions in this section we discuss these challenges that need to be addressed to make the rapid adoption of speech technology in healthcare a taxonomy is depicted in figure 5 a speech based adversarial attacks even though modern dlbased speech solutions offer great benefits to the current healthcare system there are still questions about the security of the underlying dl algorithms as recent works have shown that dl models are prone to adversar ial attacks adversarial attacks are launched by creating adversarial examples in which nonrandom imperceptible perturbations are added to input samples through optimization algorithms that aim to fool the classifier and influence it to make incorrect decisions these attacks are powerful enough to significantly bring down the performance of the stateoftheart dnn based systems 194 a popular method for generating such adversarial attacks is to generate the perturbation by utilizing gradientbased methodsmany popular attacks such as fast gradient sign method fgsm 195 jacobianbased saliency map attack jsma 196 deepfool 197 and carlini authorized licensed use limited to university

health is not only a technological but cultural transformation cultural barrier is a major challenge for digital transformation which becomes more prevalent in rural and developing areas the transformation of people from the classical method to digital health is slowed down by ignoring the importance of cultural changes and the human factors 210 therefore it is impor tant to consider cultural barriers while designing healthcare solutions in addition to cultural barriers language diversity problem is another major problem it is found that the linguistic differences among patients and medical doctors can cause patients to misinterpret medications and suffer unnecessary complications 86 therefore healthcare solutions based speech technology must be trained on multiple languages to work effectively in such situations however the development of speech technologybased healthcare systems becomes more challenging for rarely spoken languages therefore it is very important to consider language diversity while designing speechbased healthcare solutions vi o pen issues and future directions speech technology is expected to drive the change in the healthcare system by changing the conventional ways of medical treatments however there are some open issues that require serious attention and consideration of the researchers therefore in this section we highlighted such open issues and with important pointers and future research directions for the research community a privacy and ethical concerns when people use speechbased services such as speech recognition or voice authentication they provide complete possession to their voice recordings to the respective device or software in these services speech can be used by an adversary or attacker to extract users information such as speakers identity gender ethnicity information and emotional state the adversary can use this information for undesired purposes such as to fool voiceauthentication systems similarly users speech can also be edited or used to create a fake speech that the person never spoke several other privacy related concerns arise while using speech technologybased services 211 in healthcare systems information is more personal and very sensitive and people are more vulnerable to the misuse of their data therefore it is important to utilise speech processing in healthcare by considering both privacy and ethical concerns in this regard privacypreserving dl algorithms can be utilised to protect speaker identity 212 213 gender identity 214 similarly federated learning 215 is

services and the availability of large datasets is a key contributor to these developments 3435 in the networking context spatiotemporal mobile traffic is arguably a highly valuable form of data it consists of information about the timevarying traffic load observed at all locations in a target geographical region a data sample is illustrated in figure 1 plot a shows the time averaged spatial distribution of mobile traffic across a city whereas plot c portrays the space averaged temporal fluctuations of the same traffic over one week additional time series in plot c highlight the diversity of traffic volumes and patterns at different locations information on cityscale mobile traffic has numerous appli cations within and beyond networking prominent examples of network problems that benefit from mobile traffic data include resource management 913204856 mobile network infrastruc ture planning 26 network energy efficiency optimization 5770 or network monitoring 52 beyond networking

its dynamics 33 transporta tion engineering and urban planning 58 or road traffic surveil lance 39 59 limited access to mobile traffic data all aforementioned ap plications are enabled by mobile traffic data that is inherently de personalized as shown in figure 1 the data is aggregated over space eg across all users associated to a same base station or within a same spatial area and time eg during intervals of minutes to hours although its nature poses reduced privacy risks eg as corroborated by the european unions general data protection regulation spatiotemporal mobile traffic data is deemed sensitive by network operators in terms of industrial and commercial se crecy hence access to this data is not uniform and generally scant in the research community and often occurs behind restrictive non disclosure agreements ndas the result is that the potential of mobile traffic data to feed innovation is curbed and current research based on mobile traffic is not reproducible or verifiable synthesis as a solution to data access motivated by the above and to overcome the mobile traffic data access barrier we aim at generating dependable synthetic cityscale spatiotemporal mobile traffic data our goal is to design a model trained on a limited amount of realworld measurement data which can then be used to generate large amounts of highfidelity synthetic traffic from publicly available data about arbitrary geographical regions such a model primarily benefits researchers but also data holders such as network operators by using the trained model researchersconext 21 december virtual event germany kai xu et al would be finally able to independently generate dependable mobile traffic data to support their studies ideally this could lead to the adoption of a reference ensemble of synthetic datasets of spatiotem poral mobile traffic by the community ensuring the comparability of results across works based on such type of data in addition data holders can leverage the model to synthesize and share realistic mo bile traffic data from their measurements with third parties without concerns on leakage of commercially sensitive information challenges of mobile traffic generation however meeting the goal above entails a number of significant and unique challenges firstly generation requires synthesizing spatiotemporal data like that in figure 1 without prior knowledge of the historical traffic in the target area it is thus a different and more complex problem than eg mobile traffic prediction secondly ours is a controllable generation problem the model is required to capture nontrivial correlations between the urban context and the corresponding mo bile traffic so as to generate traffic for a previously unseen urban region solely based on its local contextual conditions thirdly as cities have diverse geographical span the model should be capable of generating traffic over arbitrary spatial dimensions fourthly mobile traffic information must cover long time periods to be useful in many applications therefore the model should allow generating traffic time series of any specified and potentially long duration without compromising dependability meeting these last two re quirements entails capturing complex spatiotemporal dynamics seen in realworld mobile traffic 476465 so as to preserve eg traffic peaks and flows across space and time that are rooted in mobile user movements and digital usages our contributions to attain the goal outlined above and ad dress the associated challenges we propose spectragan a novel generative model based on a tailored deep neural network architec ture in essence spectragan is a conditional neural sampler with two main components an encoder and a generator the role of the encoder is to transform contextual information that is readily avail able via public repositories broadly falling into three categories ie census land use and points of interest pois so that it can be used to control of the generation process an example of context used by our approach is the inhabitant density from population census portrayed in figure 1b for the same city of figure 1a the generator receives the hidden representation of the context produced by the encoder and outputs spatiotemporal synthetic traf fic to this end it leverages the insight that mobile traffic at any given location exhibits repeating variations over time as observed in the literature 215272 and in figure 1c this manifests in the form of small number of dominant components when traffic is viewed in the frequency domain as illustrated in figure 1d our generator directly generates the significant frequency components based on the input context then turns them into a time series via an inverse fourier transform as shown in figure 1e this already well approximates the actual traffic variations finally the generator adds a separately produced contextdriven residual temporal signal to model smaller fluctuations in traffic as in figure 1f the pro cess above is run concurrently and independently on small spatial patches which are then sewed together to obtain traffic data over the whole target region spectragan is adversarially trained a la gan the key contributions of our work are as follows a averaged traffic map b census context c weekly traffic averaged over space grey and at two loca

minus reconstruction figure 1 data for city asee 31 for details we introduce spectragan a novel conditional gan model that leverages a frequency representation of localized traffic to gener ate mobile traffic for any desired region and temporal duration given the relevant contextual data 2 this is the first solution to the important and hard problem of synthesizing spatiotemporal mobile traffic from only publicly available information 7 we evaluate spectragan with multicity mobile traffic mea surement datasets collected in two european countries 3 our results not only justify the design choices for the different com ponents of spectragan but also show its superior ability in generating highfidelity longterm traffic for previously unseen cities relative to representative baseline approaches 4 we further evaluate spectragan with practical use cases in networking and beyond and show that using synthetic traffic data generated with our model yields results comparable to those

specific requirements of spatiotemporal mobile traffic data generation as set out in 211 specifically the neural network model we devise named spectra gan takes the spatial context for a target city

approach is best explained by means of an example illustrated in figure 1 which refers to the mobile traffic observed over one week in a represen tative city from our dataset the temporal patterns in the mobile network traffic in figure 1c stand out because of the regularity in the underlying network usage reflecting weekdayweekend di chotomies circadian rhythms and routines at work commuting or other daily activities such periodicities make a frequencydomain representation via fourier transformation a compact yet effective way to capture the usagedependent temporal dynamics indeed figure 1d which shows the traffic timeseries data from each pixel in all cities of our dataset in the frequency domain highlights how only a few frequency components appear to be significant across the whole dataset consistent with observations in prior work eg 215272 the effectiveness of a spectrum based design is further proven by figure 1e which portrays the mean traffic reconstructed from the 5 significant frequency components the overlap with the original traffic confirms that the time variation in traffic can be well ap proximated by considering the significant frequency components the residual traffic in figure 1f shows the small part of difference between original and generated traffic which is separately modeled inspectragan in the time domain in the light of these considerations a neural sampler that outputs frequency components can be expected to be especially effective at modeling mobile traffic dynamics moreover there are two impor tant additional advantages with a spectrum based generation first the approach lends itself to learning relation between context and traffic data on a perpixel basis this allows capturing the differencesin significance of various frequency components at the pixel level shown in orange in figure 1d second decomposing traffic into periodic and nonperiodic parts and modeling the former in the frequency domain and the latter in the temporal domain allows overcoming the limitations of rnns mentioned earlier in 211 indeed a spectrum representation naturally adds patterns with identical periodicity in the same bin and enables a more effective learning of traffic time series over long time periods the follow ing subsection details the spectragan architecture while also explaining how it addresses the other challenges from 211

the entire city traffic map and its dynamics as a whole our model operates on smaller sized fixed dimensional subregions of the map which we call traffic patches for every time step specif ically each traffic patch xhas the spatial dimensions of and each context patch chas the spatial dimensions of we specifically choose and as we experimentally found that not only the context within the target

easily retrieved context 32 metrics we use a combination of qualitative and quantitative metrics to assess fidelity of spectragan relative to the baselines qualita tive metrics allow visual inspection of the generated data to check its unacceptability hence complementing quantitative metrics specifically we consider three forms of qualitative assessments spectragan conext 21 december virtual event germany timeaveraged city traffic maps timeseries of average citywide traffic and traffic videos showing spatiotemporal variations we also consider five different quantitative metrics outlined below that cover a wide range of aspects of interest marginal by total variation m tv this metric quantifies how well the traffic distribution of generated data matches that of the real data to compute it we first obtain the empirical marginal distributions of traffic volume across all locations pixels and time steps for both real and synthetic data then the metric is calculated as the total variation tv distance 6 between the two marginal distributions lower the value of this metric better is the match between real and synthetic data ssim on average traffic ssim ssim 78 is a standard image fidelity metric which compares two images as a function of their respective mean and variance across pixels as well as covariance between the images ssim lies between 0 and 1 closer to the latter is desirable we use this metric to quantify the spatial fidelity of the generated data by a model and compute it using the timeaveraged traffic maps for real and synthetic data autocorrelation by 1ac1 this metric also considered in previous work 46 is aimed at quantifying the temporal fidelity of the synthetic data with respect to the real data we compute it by taking the 1norm between the corresponding points of the autocorrelations of real and synthetic timeseries data at the pixel level lower values imply better performance as per this metric trainsynthetictestreal tstr this metric aims to capture the quality of generated data through the lens of a generic down stream use case as done in previous works 30 we use synthesized citywide traffic timeseries to train a linear regression model to predict city traffic snapshot for a future timestep the performance of the trained model is then evaluated on real data in terms of 2 frechet video distance fvd 69 this metric originally de signed for video data aims at evaluating the quality of spatiotempo ral data generation by treating cityscale mobile traffic over time as video data we obtain embeddings of real and synthetic videos and then compute the frechet distance between these embeddings lower this distance better the quality in the video generation set ting the embeddings are obtained via a pretrained neural network however using a neural network in our case entails a risk to intro duce a bias that may artificially favor our model instead we devise a strategy tailored to our spatiotemporal mobile traffic generation setting specifically we first spatially flatten the spatiotemporal traffic data into a multivariate timeseries we then use a signature transformation 1553 to convert the multivariate timeseries into a vector which we use as the embedding and employ vectors of the real and synthetic traffic data to compute fvd 33 baselines to evaluate spectragan we consider the

evaluation approach essentially we choose one city as a test city each time and train each model spectragan and baselines with traffic and associ ated context data for the remaining cities and repeat this process with a different test city for all cities we conduct this evaluation separately for country 1 dataset with 9 cities and country 2 dataset with 4 cities this not only allows us to study the relative fidelity of different models with respect to the metrics described in 32 but also lets us assess the generalization ability of different models to synthesizing mobile traffic for unseen cities this testing approach is also well aligned with the intended use of spectragan to generate traffic data for new regions solely from publicly avail able context for those regions finally it is worth recalling that the considered cities have various sizes ranging from 3333to5048 pixels therefore the leaveonecityout strategy allows assessing the capability of the model to generate traffic for arbitrarily sized areas since the dimension of the training cities and test city may not be the same unless otherwise specified in the following the traffic data is generated at an hourly granularity

city data generated for two representative pixels reflecting the maximum and median traffic pixels in the ground truth are also shown the corresponding real timeseries traffic pattern is shown in figure 1c the fdas gen erated data fails to preserve the diurnal pattern seen in the real data it is also unable to capture the absolute differences in traffic volumes across different locations we can make the same observation about spatial traffic patterns with fdas the timeaveraged traffic maps for city ccity d andcity hgenerated with fdas are respectively shown in fig ures 6b 6c 6d which are in stark contrast to the corresponding real traffic maps shown in figure 7 in the row labeled data the seemingly random traffic timeseries and maps generated by fdas can be attributed to the inherent limitation with this approach to treat spatial locations and time steps independently thus unable to capture strong correlations that exist across these dimensions while we find that fdas can capture

observed between models informed with realworld or spectragan generated traffic in all three use cases above in other words evaluations of the methods based on spectra gan generated data are as dependable as similar assessments with actual measurement data this proves our point that researchers could use synthetic data generated by our model to demonstrate the performance of the solutions considered in sections 5153 in a way that is both credible due to the similar performance just mentioned and reproducible as synthetic data can be more easily shared than realworld data these results pave the way for fur ther studies considering additional application use cases towards a complete assessment of the suitability of spectragan as a tool for the creation of dependable reference spatiotemporal mobile traffic datasets for the research community 6 discussion as the first model of its kind spectragan has limitations that we deem important to discuss so as to also foster further studies towards open data synthesis for networking research first there is no universal spatiotemporal granularity of the mobile traffic data that is relevant and appropriate for all down stream applications some studies have indicated that analyses of several digital human activities are adequately supported by data with a spatiotemporal resolution of 2 km 22 and 30 min utes 37 which is largely satisfied in our case also many previous works eg have designed and evaluated solutions based on mobile network traffic using datasets with resolutions of 235235 square meters in space and 10 minutes in time which are comparable to granularity of real and synthetic data in our work examples such as those above or in section 5 show that spectragan data can support studies on such concrete use cases however the suitability of spectragan data for additional applica tions needs to be assessed case by case and remains a shortcoming of our study and in the literature in general a setting

dynamics of mobile traffic in the network explicitly including them in the generative process is not needed to attain our data synthesis objective indeed the spectragan deep neural network architec

54 which consider the synthesis of mobile network traffic at macroscopic ie urban scales the approach in di francesco et al 26 requires information on bs locations and on the distribution of traffic on a peruser basis which are typically very difficult to obtain and the latter also poses privacy concerns even so the essence of synthetic mobile traffic generation in di francesco et al 26 and also that in oliveira et al 54 can be described as fitting the traffic statistics to an empirical probability distribution and then sampling from it broadly similar to that from earlier works in the

correlations 447576 and can be only conditioned on nonspatial contexts such as weather or weekdaysweekends 458184 in contrast spectragan is de signed to model spatiotemporal relations over long periods of time and to condition the generated data on spatial contexts we also show through our evaluations that a representative model from this body of literature is not effective for our traffic generation task highlighting the need for domain appropriate data generation methods like spectragan 8 conclusions we have presented spectragan a new conditional gan model spectragan is the first synthetic generation method for cityscale spatiotemporal mobile network traffic data it embeds a number of innovative aspects including the defining approach to generate the significant frequency components of the traffic spectrum for each spatial location based on local contextual attributes importantly thespectragan generation process is conditioned on context data that is typically publicly available for a city of interest so as to fos ter its usability we evaluate spectragan using multicity mobile traffic datasets for two european countries augmented with con textual data for each city our results show that spectragan not only significantly outperforms existing approaches that could be used for spatiotemporal data generation but is also able to generate highfidelity longterm mobile traffic data for completely unseen cities solely based on contextual input we also demonstrate the efficacy of spectragan through multiple application use cases in mobile networking and

make a similar impact on the networking ecosystem and will help realize a future vision of cognitive networks 1 2 in which networks will selforganize and will autonomously implement intelligent networkwide behavior to solve problems such as routing scheduling resource allocation and anomaly detection the initial attempts towards creating cognitive or intelligent networks have relied mostly on supervised ml methods which are ef cient and powerful but are limited in scope by their need for labeled data with network data becom ing increasingly voluminous with a disproportionate rise in unstructured unlabeled data there is a groundswell of interest in leveraging unsupervised ml methods to utilize unlabeled data in addition to labeled data where available to optimize network performance 3 the rising interest in applying unsupervised ml in networking applications also stems from the need to liberate ml applications from restric tive demands of supervised ml another reason of employing unsupervised ml in networking is the expensiveness of curating labeled network data at scale since labeled data may be unavailable and manual annotation is prohibitively inconvenient in addition to be outdated quickly due to the highly dynamic nature of computer networks 4 we are already witnessing the failure of human network administrators to manage and monitor all bits and pieces of network 5 and the problem will only exacerbate with further growth in the size of networks with paradigms such as becoming the internet of things iot an mlbased network management system nms is desirable in such large net works so that faultsbottlenecksanomalies may be predicted in advance with reasonable accuracy in this regard networks already have ample amount of untapped data which can pro vide us with decisionmaking insights making networks more ef cient and selfadapting with unsupervised ml the pipe dream is that every algorithm for adjusting network parame ters be it tcp congestion window or rerouting network traf c during peak time will optimize itself in a selforganizing fashion according to the environment and application user and network quality of service qos requirements and constraints 6 unsupervised ml methods in concert with existing supervised ml methods can provide a more ef cient method that lets a network manage monitor and optimize itself while keeping the human administrators in the loop with the provisioning of timely actionable information next generation networks are expected to be selfdriven which means they have the ability to selfcon gure optimize and heal 7 all these selfdriven properties can be achieved by building arti cial intelligence in the system using ml techniques selfdriven networks are supposed to utilize the network data to perform networking chores and most of the network data is imbalanced and unlabeled in order to develop a reliable datadriven network data quality must be taken care before subjecting it to an appropriate unsupervisedml 8 unsupervised ml techniques facilitate the analy sis of raw datasets thereby helping in generating analytic insights from unlabeled data recent advances in hierarchical learning clustering algorithms factor analysis latent models and outlier detection have helped signi cantly advance the state of the art in unsupervised ml techniques in particular recent unsupervised ml advancessuch as the development of deep learning techniques 22have however signif icantly advanced the ml state of the art by facilitating the processing of raw data without requiring careful engineering and domain expertise for feature crafting deep learning is a class of machine learning where hierarchical architectures are used for unsupervised feature learning and these learned features are then used for classi cation and other related tasks 23 the versatility of deep learning and distributed ml can be seen in the diversity of their applications that range from selfdriving cars to the reconstruction of brain circuits 22 unsupervised learning is also often used in conjunction with supervised learning in semisupervised learning setting to preprocess the data before analysis and thereby help in crafting a good feature representation and in nding patterns and structures in unlabeled data the rapid advances in deep neural networks the democ ratization of enormous computing capabilities through cloud computing and distributed computing and the ability to store and process large swathes of data have motivated a surging interest in applying unsupervised ml techniques in the net working eld the eld of networking also appears to be well suited to and amenable to applications of unsupervised ml techniques due to the largely distributed decisionmaking nature of its protocols the availability of large amounts of network data and the urgent need for intelligentcognitive networking consider the case of routing in networks net works these days have evolved to be very complex and they incorporate multiple physical paths for redundancy and utilize complex routing methodologies to direct the traf c the application traf c does not always take the optimal path we would expect leading to unexpected and inef cient routing performance to tame such complexity unsupervised ml techniques can autonomously selforganize the network taking into account a number of factors such as realtime network congestion statistics as well as application qos requirements 24 the purpose of this paper is to highlight the important advances in unsupervised learning and after providing a tutorial introduction to these techniques to review how such techniques have been or could be used for various tasks in modern nextgeneration networks comprising both computer

outlier detection figure 2depicts a taxonomy of unsupervised learning techniques and also the relevant sec tions in which these techniques are discussed to provide a better understanding of the application of unsupervised ml techniques in networking we have added few subsections highlighting signi cant applications of unsupervised ml techniques in networking domain a hierarchical learning hierarchical learning is de ned as learning simple and complex features from a hierarchy of multiple linear and nonlinear activations in learning models a feature is a mea surable property of the input data desired features are ideally informative discriminative and independent in statistics features are also known as explanatory or independent vari ables 26 feature learning also known as data

figure 1 outline of the paper figure 2 taxonomy of unsupervised learning techniques features from input data 27 it involves the transformation of raw data into a quanti able and comparable representation which is speci c to the property of the input but general enough for comparison to similar inputs conventionally features are handcrafted speci c to the application on hand it relies on domain knowledge but even then they do not generalize well to the variation of realworld data whichgives rise to automated learning of generalized features from the underlying structure of the input data like other learning algorithms feature learning is also divided among domains of supervised and unsupervised learning depending on the type of available data almost all unsupervised learning algorithms undergo a stage of feature extraction in order to learn data representation from unlabeled data and generate 65582 volume 7 2019m usama et al unsupervised machine learning for networking techniques applications and research challenges table 2 list of common acronyms used a feature vector on the basis of which further tasks are performed hierarchical learning is intimately related to how deep learning is performed in modern multilayer neural networks in particular deep learning techniques bene ts from the fundamental concept of arti cial neural networks anns a deep structure consists of multiple hidden layers with mul tiple neurons in each layer a nonlinear activation function a cost function and a backpropagation algorithm deep learning 40 is a hierarchical technique that models high level abstraction in data using many layers of linear and nonlinear transformations with deep enough stack of thesetransformation layers a machine can selflearn a very com plex model or representation of data learning takes place in hidden layers and the optimal weights and biases of the neurons are updated in two passes namely the forward pass and backward pass a typical ann and typical cyclic and acyclic topologies of interconnection between neurons are shown in figure 3 a brief taxonomy of unsupervised nns is presented in figure 4 an ann has three types of layers namely input hidden and output each having different activation parameters learning is the process of assigning optimal activation parameters enabling ann to perform input to output mapping for a given problem an ann may require multiple hidden layers involving a long chain of computa tions ie its depth 41 deep learning has revolutionized ml and is now increasingly being used in diverse settings eg object identi cation in images speech transcription into text matching users interests with items such as news items movies products and making recommendations etc but until 2006 relatively few people were interested in deep learning due to the high computational cost of deep learning procedures it was widely believed that training deep learning architectures in an unsupervised manner was intractable and supervised the training of deep nns dnn also showed poor performance with large generalization errors 42 however recent advances 4345 have shown that deep learning can be performed ef ciently by separate unsupervised pre training of each layer with the results revolutionizing the eld of ml starting from the input observation layer which acts as an input to the subsequent layers pretraining tends to learn data distributions while the usual supervised stage performs a local search for netuning 1 unsupervised multilayer feed forward nn unsupervised multilayer feedforward nn with reference to graph theory has a directed graph topology as shown in figure 3 it consists of no cycles ie does not have a feed back path in input propagation through nn such kind of nn is often used to approximate a nonlinear mapping between inputs and required outputs autoencoders are the prime examples of unsupervised multilayer feedforward nns a autoencoders an autoencoder is an unsupervised learning algorithm for ann used to learn compressed and encoded representation of data mostly for dimensionality reduction and for unsu pervised pretraining of feedforward nns autoencoders are generally designed using approximation function and trained using backpropagation and stochastic gradient descent sgd techniques autoencoders are the rst of their kind to use the backpropagation algorithm to train with unlabeled data autoencoders aim to learn a compact representation of the function of input using the same number of input and output units with usually less hidden units to encode a feature vector they learn the input data function by recreating the input at the output which is called encodingdecoding to learn volume 7 2019 65583m usama et al unsupervised machine learning for networking techniques applications and research challenges figure 3 illustration of an ann left different types of ann topologies right figure 4 taxonomy of unsupervised neural networks at the time of training nn in short a simple autoencoder learns a lowdimensional representation of the input data by exploiting similar recurring patterns autoencoders have different variants 46 such as vari ational autoencoders sparse autoencoders and denoising autoencoders variational autoencoder is an unsupervised learning technique used clustering dimensionality reduction and visualization and for learning complex distributions 47 in asparse autoencoder a sparse penalty on the latent layer is applied for extracting a unique statistical feature from unlabeled data finally denoising autoencoders are used to learn the mapping of a corrupted data point to its original location in the data space in an unsupervised manner for manifold learning and reconstruction distribution learning 2 unsupervised competitive learning nn unsupervised competitive learning nns is a winnertakeall neuron scheme where each neuron competes for the right of the response to a subset of the input data this scheme is used to remove the redundancies from the unstructured data two major techniques of unsupervised competitive learning nns are selforganizing maps and adaptive resonance theory nnsa selforganizing kohonen maps selforganizing maps som also known as kohonens maps 48 49 are a special class of nns that uses the concept of competitive learning in which output neurons compete amongst themselves to be activated in a realvalued output results having only single neuron or group of neu rons called winning neuron this is achieved by creat ing lateral inhibition connections negative feedback paths between neurons 50 in this orientation the network deter mines the winning neuron within several iterations subse quently it is forced to reorganize itself based on the input data distribution hence they are called selforganizing maps they were initially inspired by the human brain which has specialized regions in which different sensory inputs are rep resentedprocessed by topologically ordered computational maps in som neurons are arranged on vertices of a lattice commonly one or two dimensions the network is forced to represent higherdimensional data in lowerdimensional representation by preserving the topological properties of input data by using neighborhood function while transform ing the input into a topological space in which neuron posi tions in the space are representatives of intrinsic statistical 65584 volume 7 2019m usama et al unsupervised machine learning for networking techniques applications and research challenges features that tell us about the inherently nonlinear nature of soms training a network comprising som is essentially a threestage process after random initialization of weighted connections the three stages are as follow 51 competition each neuron in the network computes its value using a discriminant function which provides the basis of competition among the neurons neuron with the largest discriminant value in the competition group is declared the winner cooperation the winner neuron then locates the center of the topological neighborhood of excited neurons in the previous stage providing a basis for cooperation among excited neighboring neurons adaption the excited neurons in the neighborhood increasedecrease their individual values of the discrimi nant function in regard to input data distribution through subtle adjustments such that the response of the winning neuron is enhanced for similar subsequent input adap tion stage is distinguishable into two substages 1 the ordering or selforganizing phase in which weight vec tors are reordered according to topological space and 2 the convergence phase in which the map is ne tuned and declared accurate to provide statistical quan ti cation of the input space this is the phase in which the map is declared to be converged and hence trained one essential requirement in training a som is the redundancy of the input data to learn about the underlying structure of neuron activation patterns moreover suf cient quantity of data is required for creating distinguishable clus ters withstanding enough data for classi cation problem there exist a problem of gray area between clusters and cre ation of in nitely small clusters where input data has minimal patterns b adaptive resonance theory adaptive resonance theory art is another different cat egory of nn models that is based on the theory of human cognitive information processing it can be explained as an algorithm of incremental clustering which aims at forming multidimensional clusters automatically discriminating and creating new categories based on input data primarily art models are classi ed as an unsupervised learning model however there exist art variants that employ supervised and semisupervised learning approaches as well the main setback of most nn models is that they lose old information updatingdiminishing weights as new information arrives therefore an ideal model should be exible enough to accom modate new information without losing the old one and this is called the plasticitystability problem art models provide a solution to this problem by selforganizing in real time and creating a competitive environment for neurons automati cally discriminatingcreating new clusters among neurons to accommodate any new information art model resonates around topdown observer expectations and bottomup sensory information whilekeeping their difference within the threshold limits of vigi lance parameter which in result is considered as the member of the expected class of neurons 52 learning of an art model primarily consists of a comparison eld recognition eld vigilance threshold parameter and a reset module the comparison eld takes an input vector which in result is passed to best match in the recognition eld the best match is the current winning neuron each neuron in the recognition eld passes a negative output in proportion to the quality of the match which inhibits other outputs therefore exhibiting lateral inhibitions competitions once the winning neuron is selected after a competition with the best match to the input vector the reset module compares the quality of the match to the vigilance threshold if the winning neuron is within the threshold it is selected as the output else the winning neuron is reset and the process is started again to nd the next best match to the input vector in case where no neuron is capable to pass the threshold test a search procedure begins in which the reset module disables recognition neurons one at a time to nd a correct match whose weight can be adjusted to accom modate the new match therefore art models are called self organizing and can deal with the plasticitystability dilemma 3 unsupervised deep nn in recent years unsupervised deep nn has become the most successful unsupervised structure due to its application in many benchmarking problems and applications 53 three major types of unsupervised deep nns are deep belief nns deep autoencoders and convolutional nns a deep belief nn deep belief neural network or simply deep belief networks dbn is a probabilitybased generative graph model that is composed of hierarchical layers of stochastic latent variables having binary valued activations which are referred as hidden units or feature detectors the top layers in dbns have undirected symmetric connections between them forming an associative memory dbns provide a breakthrough in unsupervised learning paradigm in the learning stage dbn learns to reconstruct its input each layer acting as feature detectors dbn can be trained by greedy layerwise training starting from the top layer with raw input subsequent layers are trained with the input data from the previously visible layer 43 once the network is trained in an unsupervised manner and learned the distribution of the data it can be netuned using supervised learning methods or supervised layers can be concatenated in order to achieve the desired task for instance classi cation b deep autoencoder another famous type of dbn is the deep autoencoder which is composed of two symmetric dbnsthe rst of which is used to encode the input vector while the second decodes by the end of the training of the deep autoencoder it tends to reconstruct the input vector at the output neurons and volume 7 2019 65585m usama et al unsupervised machine learning for networking techniques applications and research challenges therefore the central layer between both dbns is the actual compressed feature vector c convolutional nn convolutional nn cnn are feed forward nn in which neurons are adapted to respond to overlapping regions in twodimensional input elds such as visual or audio input it is commonly achieved by local sparse connections among successive layers and tied shared weights followed by rec tifying and pooling layers which results in transformation invariant feature extraction another advantage of cnn over simple multilayer nn is that it is comparatively easier to train due to sparsely connected layers with the same number of hidden units cnn represents the most signi cant type of architecture for computer vision as they solve two challenges with the conventional nns 1 scalable and computationally tractable algorithms are needed for processing high dimensional images and 2 algorithms should be transfor mation invariant since objects in an image can occur at an arbitrary position however most cnns are composed of supervised feature detectors in the lower and middle hidden layers in order to extract features in an unsupervised manner a hybrid of cnn and dbn called convolutional deep belief network cdbn is proposed in 54 making probabilistic maxpooling1to cover larger input area and convolution as an inference algorithm makes this model scalable with higher dimensional input learning is processed in an unsupervised manner as proposed in 44 ie greedy layerwise lower to higher training with unlabeled data cdbn is a promising scalable generative model for learn ing translation invariant hierarchical representation from any highdimensional unlabeled data in an unsupervised man ner taking advantage of both worlds ie dbn and cnn cnn being widely employed for computer vision applica tions can be employed in computer networks for optimiza tion of quality of experience qoe and quality of service qos of multimedia content delivery over networks which is an open research problem for nextgeneration computer networks 55 4 unsupervised recurrent nn recurrent nn rnn is the most complex type of nn and hence the nearest match to an actual human brain that processes sequential inputs it can learn temporal behaviors of a given training data rnn employs an internal memory per neuron to process such sequential inputs in order to exhibit the effect of the previous event on the next compared to feed forward nns rnn is a stateful network it may contain computational cycles among states and uses time as the parameter in the transition function from one unit to another being complex and recently developed it is an open research problem to create domainspeci c rnn models and train them with sequential data speci cally there are two 1maxpooling is an algorithm of selecting the most responsive receptive eld of a given interest regionperspectives of rnn to be discussed in the scope of this survey namely the depth of the architecture and the training of the network the depth in the case of a simple arti cial nn is the presence of hierarchical nonlinear intermediate layers between the input and output signals in the case of an rnn there are different hypotheses explaining the concept of depth one hypothesis suggests that rnns are inherently deep in nature when expanded with respect to sequential input there are a series of nonlinear computations between the input at time ti and the output at time tick however at an individual discrete time step certain tran sitions are neither deep nor nonlinear there exist inputto hidden hiddentohidden and hiddentooutput transitions which are shallow in the sense that there are no intermediate nonlinear layers at discrete time step in this regard different deep architectures are proposed in 56 that introduce inter mediate nonlinear transitional layers in between the input hidden and output layers another novel approach is also proposed by stacking hidden units to create a hierarchical representation of hidden units which mimic the deep nature of standard deep nns due to the inherently complex nature of rnn to the best of our knowledge there is no widely adopted approach for training rnns and many novel methods both supervised and unsupervised are introduced to train rnns considering unsupervised learning of rnn in the scope of this paper 57 employ long shortterm memory lstm rnn to be trained in an unsupervised manner using unsupervised learning algo rithms namely binary information gain optimization and non parametric entropy optimization in order to make a network to discriminate between a set of temporal sequences and cluster them into groups results have shown remarkable ability of rnns for learning temporal sequences and cluster ing them based on a variety of features two major types of unsupervised recurrent nn are hop eld nn and boltzmann machine a hopfield nn hop eld nn is a cyclic recurrent nn where each node is connected to others hop eld nn provides an abstraction of circular shift register memory with nonlinear activation functions to form a global energy function with guaranteed convergence to local minima hop eld nns are used for nding clusters in the data without a supervisor b boltzmann machine the boltzmann machine is a stochastic symmetric recur rent nn that is used for search and learning problems due to binary vector based simple learning algorithm of boltzmann machine very interesting features representing the complex unstructured data can be learned 58 since the boltzmann machine uses multiple hidden layers as fea ture detectors the learning algorithm becomes very slow to avoid slow learning and to achieve faster feature detection instead of boltzmann machine a faster version namely the restricted boltzmann machine rbm is used for practical 65586 volume 7 2019m usama et al unsupervised machine learning for networking techniques applications and research challenges figure 5 clustering process problems 59 restricted boltzmann machine learns a prob ability distribution over its input data but since it is restricted in its layer to layer connectivity rbm loses its property of recurrence it is faster than a boltzmann machine because it only uses one hidden layer as a feature detector layer rbm is used for dimensionality reduction clustering and feature learning in computer networks 5 significant applications of hierarchical learning in networks annsdnns are the most researched topic when creat ing intelligent systems in computer vision and natural lan guage processing whereas their application in computer networks are very limited they are employed in differ ent networking applications such as classi cation of traf c anomalyintrusion detection detecting distributed denial of service ddos attacks and resource management in cogni tive radios 60 the motivation of using dnn for learning and predicting in networks is the unsupervised training that detects hidden patterns in ample amount of data that is near to impossible for a human to handcraft features catering for all scenarios moreover many new research shows that a single model is not enough for the need of some applications so developing a hybrid nn architecture having pros and cons of different models creates a new ef cient nn which provides even better results such an approach is used in 61 in which a hybrid model of art and rnn is employed to learn and predict traf c volume in a computer network in real time realtime prediction is essential to adaptive ow control which is achieved by using hybrid techniques so that art can learn new input patterns without retraining the entire network and can predict accurately in the time series of rnn furthermore dnns are also being used in resource allocation and qoeqos optimizations using nn for opti mization ef cient resource allocation without affecting the user experience can be crucial in the time when resources are scarce authors of 62 63 propose a simple dbn for opti mizing multimedia content delivery over wireless networks by keeping qoe optimal for end users table 3also provides a tabulated description of hierarchical learning in networking applications however these are just a few notable examples of deep learning and neural networks in networks refer to section iiifor more applications and detailed discussion on deep learning and neural networks in computer networksb data clustering clustering is an unsupervised learning task that aims to nd hidden patterns in unlabeled input data in the form of clus ters 64 simply put it encompasses the arrangement of data in meaningful natural groupings on the basis of the similarity between different features as illustrated in figure 5 to learn about its structure clustering involves the organization of data in such a way that there are high intracluster and low intercluster similarity the resulting structured data is termed asdataconcept 65 clustering is used in numerous applica tions from the elds of ml data mining network analysis pattern recognition and computer vision the various tech niques used for data clustering are described in more detail later in section iib in networking clustering techniques are widely deployed for applications such as traf c analysis and anomaly detection in all kinds of networks eg wireless sensor networks and mobile adhoc networks with anomaly detection 66 clustering improves performance in various applications mcgregor et al 67 propose an ef cient packet tracing approach using the expectationmaximization em proba bilistic clustering algorithm which groups ows packets into a small number of clusters where the goal is to analyze network traf c using a set of representative clusters a brief overview of different types of clustering methods and their relationships can be seen in figure 6 clustering can be divided into three main types 68 namely hierarchical clustering bayesian clustering and partitional clustering hierarchical clustering creates a hierarchical decomposition of data whereas bayesian clustering forms a probabilistic model of the data that decides the fate of a new test point probabilistically in contrast partitional clustering constructs multiple partitions and evaluates them on the basis of certain criterion or characteristic such as the euclidean distance before delving into the general subtypes of clustering there are two unique clustering techniques which need to be discussed namely densitybased clustering andgridbased clustering in some cases densitybased clustering is classi ed as a partitional clustering technique however we have kept it separate considering its applications in networking densitybased models target the most densely populated area of data space and separate it from areas having low densities thus forming clusters 69 70 use densitybased clustering to cluster data stream in real time which is important in many volume 7 2019 65587m usama et al unsupervised machine learning for networking techniques applications and research challenges table 3 applications of hierarchical learning deep learning in networking applications figure 6 clustering taxonomy applications eg intrusion detection in networks another technique is gridbased clustering which divides the data space into cells to form a gridlike structure subsequently all clustering actions are performed on this grid 71 71 also present a novel approach that uses a customized grid based clustering algorithm to detect anomalies in networks 72 proposed a novel method for clustering the time series data this scheme was based on a distance measure between temporal features of the time series we move on next to describe three major types of data clus tering approaches as per the taxonomy is shown in figure 61 hierarchical clustering hierarchical clustering is a wellknown strategy in data min ing and statistical analysis in which data is clustered into a hierarchy of clusters using an agglomerative bottomup or a divisive topdown approach almost all hierarchical clus tering algorithms are unsupervised and deterministic the primary advantage of hierarchical clustering over unsuper vised kmeans and em algorithms is that it does not require the number of clusters to be speci ed beforehand however this advantage comes at the cost of computational ef ciency common hierarchical clustering algorithms have at least 65588 volume 7 2019m usama et al unsupervised machine learning for networking techniques applications and research challenges quadratic computational complexity compared to the linear complexity of kmeans and em algorithms hierarchical clustering methods have a pitfall these methods fail to accu rately classify messy highdimensional data as its heuristic may fail due to the structural imperfections of empirical data furthermore the computational complexity of the com mon agglomerative hierarchical algorithms is nphard som as discussed in section iia2 is a modern approach that can overcome the shortcomings of hierarchical models 73 2 bayesian clustering bayesian clustering is a probabilistic clustering strategy where the posterior distribution of the data is learned on the basis of a prior probability distribution bayesian clustering is divided into two major categories namely parametric and nonparametric 74 the major difference between para metric and nonparametric techniques is the dimensionality of parameter space if there are nite dimensions in the parameter space the underlying technique is called bayesian parametric otherwise the underlying technique is called bayesian nonparametric a major pitfall with the bayesian clustering approach is that the choice of the wrong prior prob ability distributions can distort the projection of the data 75 performed bayesian nonparametric clustering of network traf c data to determine the network application type 3 partitional clustering partitional clustering corresponds to a special class of cluster ing algorithms that decomposes data into a set of disjoint clus ters given nobservations the clustering algorithm partitions a data into knclusters 76 partitional clustering is further classi ed into kmeans clustering and mixture models a kmeans clustering kmeans clustering is a simple yet widely used approach for classi cation it takes a statistical vector as an input to deduce classi cation models or classi ers kmeans cluster ing tends to distribute mobservations into nclusters where each observation belongs to the nearest cluster the member ship of observation to a cluster is determined using the cluster mean kmeans clustering is used in numerous applications in the domains of network analysis and traf c classi ca tion 77 used kmeans clustering in conjunction with super vised id3 decision tree learning models to detect anomalies in a network an id3 decision tree is an iterative supervised decision tree algorithm based on the concept learning system kmeans clustering provided excellent results when used in traf c classi cation 78 showed that kmeans cluster ing performs well in traf c classi cation with an accuracy of 90 kmeans clustering is also used in the domain of network security and intrusion detection reference 79 proposed a kmeans algorithm for intrusion detection experimental results on a subset of kdd99 dataset shows that the detec tion rate stays above 96 while the false alarm rate stays below 4 results and analysis of experiments on kmeansalgorithm have demonstrated a better ability to search clusters globally another variation of kmeans is known as kmedoids in which rather than taking the mean of the clusters the most centrally located data point of a cluster is considered as the reference point of the corresponding cluster 80 few of the applications of kmedoids in the spectrum of anomaly detection can be seen here 80 81 b mixture models mixture models are powerful probabilistic models for uni variate and multivariate data mixture models are used to make statistical inferences and deductions about the prop erties of the subpopulations given only observations on the pooled population they have also used to statistically model data in the domains of pattern recognition computer vision ml etc finite mixtures which are a basic type of mixture model naturally model observations that are produced by a set of alternative random sources inferring and deduc ing different parameters from these sources based on their respective observations lead to clustering of the set of obser vations this approach to clustering tackles drawbacks of heuristicbased clustering methods and hence it is proven to be an ef cient method for node classi cation in any large scale network and has shown to yield effective results com pared to techniques commonly used for instance kmeans and hierarchical agglomerative methods rely on supervised design decisions such as the number of clusters or validity of models 82 moreover combining the em algorithm with mixture models produces remarkable results in deciphering the structure and topology of the vertices connected through a multidimensional network 83 reference 84",

detailed discussion on some salient clustering applications in the con text of networks c latent variable models a latent variable model is a statistical model that relates the manifest variables with a set of latent or hidden vari ables latent variable model allows us to express relatively complex distributions in terms of tractable joint distributions over an expanded variable space 95 underlying variables of a process are represented in higher dimensional space using a xed transformation and stochastic variations are known as latent variable models where the distribution in higher dimension is due to small number of hidden variables acting in a combination 96 these models are used for data visualization dimensionality reduction optimization distribution learning blind signal separation and factor anal ysis next we will begin our discussion on various latent variable models namely mixture distribution factor analysis blind signal separation nonnegative matrix factorization bayesian networks probabilistic graph models pgm hidden markov model hmm and nonlinear dimensional ity reduction techniques which further includes generative topographic mapping multidimensional scaling principal curves isomap localliy linear embedding and tdistributed stochastic neighbor embedding 1 mixture distribution mixture distribution is an important latent variable model that is used for estimating the underlying density functionmixture distribution provides a general framework for den sity estimation by using the simpler parametric distributions expectation maximization em algorithm is used for esti mating the mixture distribution model 97 through max imization of the loglikelihood of the mixture distribution model 2 factor analysis another important type of latent variable model is factor analysis which is a density estimation model it has been used quite often in collaborative ltering and dimensionality reduction it is different from other latent variable models in terms of the allowed variance for different dimensions as most latent variable models for dimensionality reduction in conventional settings use a xed variance gaussian noise model in the factor analysis model latent variables have diagonal covariance rather than isotropic covariance 3 blind signal separation blind signal separation bss also referred to as blind source separation is the identi cation and separation of independent source signals from mixed input signals with out or very little information about the mixing process figure 7depicts the basic bss process in which source signals are extracted from a mixture of signals it is a funda mental and challenging problem in the domain of signal pro cessing although the concept is extensively used in all types of multidimensional data processing most common techniques employed for bss are principal component analysis pca and independent component analysis ica a principal component analysis pca is a statisti cal procedure that utilizes orthogonal transformation on the data to convert nnumber of possibly correlated vari ables into lesser knumber of uncorrelated variables named 65590 volume 7 2019m usama et al unsupervised machine learning for networking techniques applications and research challenges figure 7 blind signal separation bss a mixed signal composed of various input signals mixed by some mixing process is blindly processed ie with no or minimal information about the mixing process to show the original signals principal components principal components are arranged in the descending order of their variability rst one catering for the most variable and the last one for the least being a primary technique for exploratory data analysis pca takes a cloud of data in ndimensions and rotates it such that maxi mum variability in the data is visible using this technique it brings out the strong patterns in the dataset so that these patterns are more recognizable thereby making the data easier to explore and visualize pca has primarily been used for dimensionality reduction in which input data of ndimensions is reduced to kdimen sions without losing critical information in the data the choice of the number of principal components is a question of the design decision much research has been conducted on selecting the number of components such as crossvalidation approximations 98 optimally kis chosen such that the ratio of the average squared projection error to the total variation in the data is less than or equal to 1 by which 99 of the variance is retained in the kprincipal components but depending on the application domain different designs can increasedecrease the ratio while maximizing the required output commonly many features of a dataset are often highly correlated hence pca results in retaining 99 of the variance while signi cantly reducing the data dimensions b independent component analysis ica is another tech nique for bss that focuses on separating multivariate input data into additive components with the underlying assump tion that the components are nongaussian and statistically independent the most common example to understand ica is the cocktail party problem in which there are npeople talking simultaneously in a room and one tries to listen to a single voice ica actually separates source signals from input mixed signal by either minimizing the statistical depen dence or maximizing the nongaussian property among the components in the input signals by keeping the underly ing assumptions valid statistically ica can be seen as the extension of pca while pca tries to maximize the second moment variance of data hence relying heavily on gaussian features on the other hand ica exploits inherently non gaussian features of the data and tries to maximize the fourth moment of linear combination of inputs to extract nonnormal source components in the data 994",

called ef cient fast ica efica for detecting and estimating the symbol signals from the mixed cdma signals received from the source endpoint in other literature pca uses a probabilistic approach to nd the degree of con dence in detecting an anomaly in wireless networks 114 furthermore pca is also chosen as a method of clustering and designing wireless sensor networks wsns with multiple sink nodes

estimation using bayesian network in lan is dis cussed in 123 similarly bayes theory and pgm are both used in lowdensity parity check ldpc and turbo codes which are the fundamental components of information coding theory table 5also provides a tabulated description of latent variable models applications in networking d dimensionality reduction representing data in fewer dimensions is another well established task of unsupervised learning real world data often have high dimensionsin many datasets these dimen sions can run into thousands even millions of potentially correlated dimensions 133 however it is observed that the intrinsic dimensionality governing parameters of the data is less than the total number of dimensions in order to nd the essential pattern of the underlying data by extracting intrinsic dimensions it is necessary that the real essence is not lost eg it may be the case that a phenomenon is observable only in higherdimensional data and is suppressed in lower dimensions these phenomena are said to suffer from the curse of dimensionality 134 while dimensionality reduc tionis sometimes used interchangeably with feature selection 135 136 a subtle difference exists between the two 137 feature selection is traditionally performed as a supervised task with a domain expert helping in handcrafting a set of critical features of the data such an approach generally can perform well but is not scalable and prone to judgment bias dimensionality reduction on the other hand is more generally an unsupervised task where instead of choosing a subset of features it creates new features dimensions as a function of all features said differently feature selection considers supervised data labels while dimensionality reduc tion focuses on the data points and their distributions in an ndimensional space there exist different techniques for reducing data dimen sions 138 including projection of higher dimensional points onto lower dimensions independent representation and sparse representation which should be capable of recon structing the approximate data dimensionality reduction is useful for data modeling compression and visualization 65592 volume 7 2019m usama et al unsupervised machine learning for networking techniques applications and research challenges table 5 applications of latent variable models in networking applications by creating representative functional dimensions of the data and eliminating redundant ones it becomes easier to visualize and form a learning model independent representation tries to disconnect the source of variation underlying the data distribution such that the dimensions of the representation are statistically independent 40 sparse representation tech nique represents the data vectors in linear combinations of small basis vectors it is worth noting here that many of the latent variable mod els eg pca ica factor analysis also function as tech niques for dimensionality reduction in addition to techniques such as pca icawhich infer the latent inherent structure of the data through a linear projection of the dataa number of nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques have also been developed and will be focused upon in this section to avoid repetition of linear dimensionality reduction techniques that have already been covered as part of the previous subsec tion linear dimensionality reduction techniques are useful in many settings but these methods may miss important nonlin ear structure in the data due to their subspace assumption which posits that the highdimensional data points lie on a linear subspace for example on a 2d or 3d plane such an assumption fails in high dimensions when data points are random but highly correlated with neighbors in such environ ments nonlinear dimensionality reductions through manifold learning techniqueswhich can be construed as an attempt to generalize linear frameworks like pca so that nonlinear structure in data can also be recognizedbecome desirableeven though some supervised variants also exist manifold learning is mostly performed in an unsupervised fashion using the nonlinear manifold substructure learned from the highdimensional structure of the data from the data itself without the use of any predetermined classi er or labeled data some nonlinear dimensionality reduction manifold learning techniques are described below 1 isomap isomap is a nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique that nds the underlying low dimensional geometric information about a dataset algorithmic features of pca and mds are combined to learn the low dimensional nonlinear man ifold structure in the data 139 isomap uses geodesic dis tance along the shortest path to calculate the low dimension representation shortest path which can be computed using dijkstras algorithm 2 generative topographic model generative topographic mapping gtm represents the nonlinear latent variable mapping from continuous low dimensional distributions embedded in high dimensional spaces 140 data space in gtm is represented as reference vectors and these vectors are a projection of latent points in data space it is a probabilistic variant of som and works by calculating the euclidean distance between data points gtm optimizes the loglikelihood function and the resulting probability de nes the density in data space

applications 3 locally linear embedding locally linear embedding lle 133 is an unsupervised nonlinear dimensionality reduction algorithm lle repre sents data in lower dimensions yet preserving the higher dimensional embedding lle depicts data in a single global coordinate of lower dimensional mapping of input data lle is used to visualize multidimensional dimensional manifolds and feature extraction 4 principal curves the principal curve is a nonlinear dataset summarizing tech nique where nonparametric curves pass through the middle of multidimensional dataset providing the summary of the dataset 141 these smooth curves minimize the average squared orthogonal distance between data points this process also resembles the maximum likelihood for nonlinear regres sion in the presence of gaussian noise 142 5 nonlinear multidimensional scaling nonlinear multidimensional scaling nmds 143 is a non linear latent variable representation scheme it works as an alternative scheme for factor analysis in factor analysis a multivariate normal distribution is assumed and similari ties between different objects are expressed as a correlation matrix whereas nmds does not impose such a condition and it is designed to reach the optimal low dimensional con guration where similarities and dissimilarities among matri ces can be observed nmds is also used in data visualization and mining tools for depicting the multidimensional data in 3 dimensions based on the similarities in the distance matrix 6 tdistributed stochastic neighbor embedding tdistributed stochastic neighbor embedding tsne is another nonlinear dimensionality reduction scheme it is used to represent high dimensional data in 2 or 3 dimensionstsne constructs a probability distribution in high dimen sional space and constructs a similar distribution in lower dimensions and minimizes the kullbackaleibler kl divergence between two distributions which is a useful way to measure the difference between two probability distributions 144 table 6 also provides a tabulated description of dimen sionality reduction applications in networking the applica tions of nonlinear dimensionality reduction methods are later described in detail in section iiid e outlier detection outlier detection is an important application of unsupervised learning a sample point that is distant from other samples is called an outlier an outlier may occur due to noise measure ment error heavy tail distributions and a mixture of two dis tributions there are two popular underlying techniques for unsupervised outlier detection upon which many algorithms are designed namely the nearest neighbor based technique and clustering based method 1 nearest neighbor based outlier detection the nearest neighbor method works on estimating the euclidean distances or average distance of every sample from all other samples in the dataset there are many algorithms based on nearest neighbor based techniques with the most famous extension of the nearest neighbor being a knearest neighbor technique in which only k nearest neighbors par ticipate in the outlier detection 154 local outlier factor is another outlier detection algorithm which works as an exten sion of the knearest neighbor algorithm connectivitybased outlier factors 155 in uenced outlierness 156 and local outlier probability models 157 are few famous examples of the nearest neighbor based techniques 65594 volume 7 2019m usama et al unsupervised machine learning for networking techniques applications and research challenges 2 cluster based outlier detection clustering based methods use the conventional kmeans clustering technique to nd dense locations in the data and then perform density estimation on those clusters after den sity estimation a heuristic is used to classify the formed clus ter according to the cluster size anomaly score is computed by calculating the distance between every point and its cluster head local density cluster based outlier factor 158 cluster ing based multivariate gaussian outlier score 159 160 and histogram based outlier score 161 are the famous cluster based outlier detection models in literature svm and pca are also suggested for outlier detection in literature 3 significant applications of outlier detection in networks outlier detection algorithms are used in many different appli cations such as intrusion detection fraud detection data leak age prevention surveillance energy consumption anomalies forensic analysis critical state detection in designs elec trocardiogram and computed tomography scan for tumor detection unsupervised anomaly detection is performed by estimating the distances and densities of the provided non annotated data 162 more applications of outlier detection schemes will be discussed in section iii f lessons learnt key lessons drawn from the review of unsupervised learning techniques are summarized below 1 hierarchical learning techniques are the most pop ular schemes in literature for feature detection and extraction 2 learning the joint distribution of a complex distribution over an expanded variable space is a dif cult task latent variable models have been the recommended and wellestablished schemes in literature for this prob lem these models are also used for dimensionality reduction and better representation of data 3 visualization of unlabeled multidimensional data is another unsupervised task in this research we have explored the dimensionality reduction as an underlying scheme for developing better multidimensional data visualization tools",

        "prompt": "iii applications of unsupervised learning in networking in this section we will introduce some signi cant appli cations of the unsupervised learning techniques that have been discussed in section iiin the context of computer net works we highlight the broad spectrum of applications in networking and emphasize the importance of mlbased tech niques rather than classical hardcoded statistical methods for achieving more ef ciency adaptability and performance enhancement a internet traffic classification internet traf c classi cation is of prime importance in net working as it provides a way to understand develop andmeasure the internet internet traf c classi cation is an important component for service providers to understand the characteristics of the service such as quality of service quality of experience user behavior network security and many other key factors related to the overall structure of a network 163 in this subsection we will survey the unsuper vised learning applications in network traf c classi cation as networks evolve at a rapid pace malicious intruders are also evolving their strategies numerous novel hacking and intrusion techniques are being regularly introduced causing severe nancial jolts to companies and headaches to their administrators tackling these unknown intrusions through accurate traf c classi cation on the network edge therefore becomes a critical challenge and an important component of the network security domain initially when networks used to be small simple portbased classi cation technique that tried to identify the associated application with the corre sponding packet based on its port number was used however this approach is now obsolete because recent malicious soft ware uses a dynamic portnegotiation mechanism to bypass rewalls and security applications a number of contrast ing internet traf c classi cation techniques have been pro posed since then and some important ones are discussed next most of the modern traf c classi cation methods use different ml and clustering techniques to produce accurate clusters of packets depending on their applications thus pro ducing ef cient packet classi cation 10 the main purpose of classifying networks traf c is to recognize the destination application of the corresponding packet and to control the ow of the traf c when needed such as prioritizing one ow over others another important aspect of traf c classi cation is to detect intrusions and malicious attacks or screen out forbidden applications packets the rst step in classifying internet traf c is selecting accurate features which is an extremely important yet com plex task accurate feature selection helps ml algorithms to avoid problems like class imbalance low ef ciency and low classi cation rate there are three major feature selec tion methods in internet traf c for classi cation the l ter method the wrapper based method and the embedded method these methods are based on different ml and genetic learning algorithms 164 two major concerns in feature selection for internet traf c classi cation are the large size of data and imbalanced traf c classes to deal with these issues and to ensure accurate feature selection a minmax ensemble feature selection scheme is proposed in 165 a new informationtheoretic approach for feature selection for skewed datasets is described in 166 this algorithm has resolved the multiclass imbalance issue but it does not resolve the issues of feature selection in 2017 an unsupervised autoencoder based scheme has outperformed previous feature learning schemes autoencoders were used as a generative model and were trained in a way that the bottleneck layer learned a latent representation of the feature set these features were then used for malware classi cation volume 7 2019 65595m usama et al unsupervised machine learning for networking techniques applications and research challenges and anomaly detection to produce results that improved the state of the art in feature selection 30 much work has been done on classifying traf c based on supervised ml techniques initially in 2004 the concept of clustering bidirectional ows of packets came out with the use of em probabilistic clustering algorithm which clusters the ows depending on various attributes such as packet size statistics interarrival statistics byte counts and connection duration etc 67 furthermore clustering is combined with the above model 172 this strategy uses naive bayes clus tering to classify traf c in an automated fashion recently unsupervised ml techniques have also been introduced in the domain of network security for classifying traf c major developments include a hybrid model to classify traf c in more unsupervised manner 173 which uses both labeled and unlabeled data to train the classi er making it more durable and ef cient however later on completely unsuper vised methods for traf c classi cation have been proposed and still much work is going on in this area initially a com pletely unsupervised approach for traf c classi cation was employed using the kmeans clustering algorithm combined with log transformation to classify data into corresponding clusters then 78 highlighted that using kmeans and this method for traf c classi cation can improve accuracy by 10 to achieve an overall 90 accuracy another improved and faster approach was proposed in 2006 174 which examines the size of the rst ve packets and determines the application correctly using unsu pervised learning techniques this approach has shown to produce better results than the stateoftheart traf c classi er and also has removed its drawbacks such as dealing with outliers or unknown packets etc another similar auto mated traf c classi er and application identi er can be seen in 175 and they use the autoclass unsupervised bayesian classi er which automatically learns the inherent natural classes in a dataset in 2013 another novel strategy for traf c classi cation known as network traf c classi cation using correlation was proposed 167 which uses nonparametric nn combined with statistical measurement of correlation within data to ef ciently classify traf c the presented approach addressed the three major drawbacks of supervised and unsupervised learning classi cation models rstly they are inappropriate for sparse complex networks as labeling of training data takes too much computation and time secondly many supervised schemes such as svm are not robust to training data size and lastly and most importantly all supervised and unsupervised algorithms perform poorly if there are few training samples thus classifying the traf c using correlations appears to be more ef cient and adapting 176 compared four ann approaches for computer network traf c and modeled the internet traf c like a time series and used mathematical methods to predict the time series a greedy layerwise train ing for unsupervised stacked autoencoder produced excellent classi cation results but at the cost of signi cant system complexity genetic algorithm combined with constraintclustering process is used for internet traf c data characteri zation 177 in another work a twophased ml approach for internet traf c classi cation using kmeans and c50 deci sion tree is presented in 178 where the average accuracy of classi cation was 9237 a new approach for internet traf c classi cation has been introduced in 2017 by 88 in which unidirectional and bidi rectional information is extracted from the collected traf c and kmeans clustering is performed on the basis of statistical properties of the extracted ows a supervised classi er then classi es these clusters another unsupervised learning based algorithm for internet traf c detection is described in 179 where a restricted boltzmann machine based svm is pro posed for traf c detection this paper model the detection as a classi cation problem results were compared with ann and decision tree algorithms on the basis of precision and recall application of deep learning algorithms in internet traf c classi cation has been discussed in 16 with this work also outlining the open research challenges in applying deep learning for internet traf c classi cation these problems are related to training the models for big data since internet data for deep learning falls in big data regime optimiza tion issues of the designed models given the uncertainty in internet traf c and scalability of deep learning architectures in internet traf c classi cation to cope with the challenges of developing a exible highperformance platform that can capture data from a highspeed network operating at more than 60 gbps 180 have introduced a platform for high speed packet to tuple sequence conversion which can sig ni cantly advance the state of the art in realtime network traf c classi cation in another work 181 used stacked autoencoders for internet traf c classi cation and produced more than 90 accurate results for the two classes in kdd 99 dataset deep belief network combined with gaussian model employed for internet traf c prediction in wireless mesh backbone network has been shown to outperform the pre vious maximum likelihood estimation technique for traf c prediction 182 given the uncertainty of wlan channel traf c classi cation is very tricky 169 proposed a new variant of gaussian mixture model by incorporating universal background model and used it for the rst time to classify the wlan traf c a brief overview of the different internet traf c classi cation systems classi ed on the basis of unsu pervised technique and tasks discussed earlier is presented in the table 7 b anomalyintrusion detection the increasing use of networks in every domain has increased the risk of network intrusions which makes user privacy and the security of critical data vulnerable to attacks according to the annual computer crime and security survey 2005 199 conducted by the combined teams of csi computer security institute and fbi federal bureau of investigation total nancial losses faced by companies due to the security attacks and network intrusions were estimated as us 130 million 65596 volume 7 2019m usama et al unsupervised machine learning for networking techniques applications and research challenges table 7 internet traffic classification with respect to unsupervised learning techniques and tasks moreover according to the symantec internet security threat report 200 approximately 5000 new vulnerabilities were identi ed in the year 2015 in addition more than 400 million new variants of malware programs and 9 major breaches were detected exposing 10 million identities there fore insecurity in todays networking environment has given rise to the everevolving domain of network security and intrusionanomaly detection 200 in general intrusion detection systems ids recognize or identify any act of security breach within a computer or a network speci cally all requests which could compromise the con dentiality and availability of data or resources of a system or a particular network generally intrusion detection systems can be categorized into three types 1 signature based intrusion detection systems 2 anomaly detection systems and 3 compoundhybrid detection systems which include selective attributes of both preceding systems signature detection also known as misuse detection is a technique that was initially used for tracing and identify ing misuses of users important data computer resources and intrusions in the network based on the previously col lected or stored signatures of intrusion attempts the most important bene t of a signaturebased system is that a com puter administrator can exactly identify the type of attack a computer is currently experiencing based on the sequence of the packets de ned by stored signatures however it is nearly impossible to maintain the signature database of all evolving possible attacks thus this pitfall of the signature based technique has given rise to anomaly detection systems anomaly detection system ads is a modern intrusion and anomaly detection system initially it creates a baseline image of a system pro le its network and user program activity then on the basis of this baseline image ads classi es any activity deviating from this behavior as an intrusion few bene ts of this technique are rstly they are capableof detecting insider attacks such as using system resources through another user pro le secondly each ads is based on a customized user pro le which makes it very dif cult for attackers to ascertain which types of attacks would not set an alarm and lastly it detects unknown behavior in a computer system rather than detecting intrusions thus it is capable of detecting any unknown sophisticated attack which is different from the users usual behavior however these bene ts come with a tradeoff in which the process of training a system on a users normal pro le and maintaining those pro les is a time consuming and challenging task if an inappropriate user pro le is created it can result in poor performance since ads detects any behavior that does not align with a users normal pro le its false alarm rate can be high lastly another pitfall of ads is that a malicious user can train ads gradually to accept inappropriate traf c as normal as anomaly and intrusion detection have been a popular research area since the origin of networking and internet numerous supervised as well as unsupervised 201 learning techniques have been applied to ef ciently detect intrusions and malicious activities however latest research focuses on the application of unsupervised learning techniques in this area due to the challenge and promise of using big data for optimizing networks initial work focuses on the application of basic unsu pervised clustering algorithms for detecting intrusions and anomalies in 2005 an unsupervised approach was proposed based on density and gridbased clustering to accurately classify the highdimensional dataset in a set of clusters those points which do not fall in any cluster are marked as abnormal 71 this approach has produced good results but the false positive rate was very high in followup work another improved approach that used fuzzy rough cmeans clustering was introduced 85 195 kmeans clustering is also another famous approach used for detecting anomalies volume 7 2019 65597m usama et al unsupervised machine learning for networking techniques applications and research challenges which were later proposed in 2009 79 which showed great accuracy and outperformed existing unsupervised methods however later in 2012 an improved method which used kmeans clustering combined with the c45 decision tree algorithm was proposed 192 to produce more ef cient results than prior approaches 202 combines cluster centers and nearest neighbors for effective feature representation which ensures a better intrusion detection however a limi tation with this approach is that it is not able to detect user to resource and remote to local attacks another scheme using unsupervised learning approach for anomaly detection is pre sented in 203 the presented scheme combines subspace clustering and correlation analysis to detect anomalies and provide protection against unknown anomalies this exper iment used wide backbone networks data 204 spanning over six years and produced better results than previous kmeans based techniques work presented in 205 shows that for different intrusions schemes there are a small set of measurements required to differentiate between normal and anomalous traf c the authors used two coclustering schemes to perform clustering and to determine which measurement subset contributed the most towards accurate detection another famous approach for increasing detection accu racy is ensemble learning work presented in 206 employed many hybrid incremental ml approaches with gradient boosting and ensemble learning to achieve better detection performance authors in 207 surveyed anomaly detection research from 2009 to 2014 and nd out the unique algo rithmic similarity for anomaly detection in internet traf c most of the algorithms studied have following sim ilarities 1 removal of redundant information in training phase to ensure better learning performance 2 feature selec tion usually performed using unsupervised techniques and increases the accuracy of detection 3 use ensembles clas si ers or hybrid classi ers rather than baseline algorithms to get better results authors in 208 have developed an arti cial immune system based intrusion detection system they have used densitybased spatial clustering of applica tions with noise to develop an immune system against the network intrusion detection the application of unsupervised intrusion detection in cloud network is presented in 209 where authors have pro posed a fuzzy clustering ann to detect the less frequent attacks and improve the detection stability in cloud networks another application of unsupervised intrusion detection sys tem for clouds is surveyed in 210 where fuzzy logic based intrusion detection system using supervised and unsupervised ann is proposed for intrusion detection this approach is used for dos and ddos attacks where the scale of the attack is very large network intrusion anomaly detection system nids based on kmeans clustering are surveyed in 211 this survey is unique as it provides distance and similarity measure of the intrusion detection and this perspective has not been studied before 2015 unsupervised learning based appli cations of anomaly detection schemes for wireless personalarea networks wireless sensor networks cyberphysical sys tems and wlans are surveyed in 212 another paper 213 reviewing anomaly detection has pre sented the application of unsupervised svm and clustering based applications in network intrusion detection systems unsupervised discretization algorithm is used in bayesian network classi er for intrusion detection which is based on bayesian model averaging 214 the authors show that the proposed algorithm performs better than the naive bayes classi er in terms of accuracy on the nslkdd intru sion detection dataset border gateway protocol bgp the core internet interautonomous systems interas rout ing protocolis also error prone to intrusions and anoma lies to detect these bgp anomalies many supervised and unsupervised ml solutions such as hidden markov models and principal component analysis have been proposed in literature 215 another problem for anomaly detection is low volume attacks which have become a big challenge for network traf c anomaly detection while longrange depen dencies lrd are used to identify these low volume attacks lrd usually works on aggregated traf c volume but since the volume of traf c is low the attacks can pass undetected to accurately identify low volume abnormalities 216 pro posed the examination of lrd behavior of control plane and data plane separately to identify low volume attacks other than clustering another widely used unsupervised technique for detecting malicious and abnormal behavior in networks is soms the specialty of soms is that they can automatically organize a variety of inputs and deduce patterns among themselves and subsequently determine whether the new input ts in the deduced pattern or not thus detecting abnormal inputs 184 185 soms have also been used in hostbased intrusion detection systems in which intruders and abusers are identi ed at a host system through incom ing data traf c 188 later on a more robust and ef cient technique was proposed to analyze data patterns in tcp traf c 186 furthermore complex nns have also been applied to solve the same problem and remarkable results have been produced a few examples include the application of art combined with som 189 the use of pca can also be seen in detecting intrusions 197 nmf has also been used for detecting intruders and abusers 112 and lastly dimensionality reduction techniques have also been applied to eradicate intrusions and anomalies in the system 198 for more applications refer to table 8 which classi es different network anomaly and intrusion detection systems on the basis of unsupervised learning techniques discussed earlier c network operations optimizations and analytics network management comprises of all the operations included in initializing monitoring and managing of a com puter network based on its network functions which are the primary requirements of the network operations the general purpose of network management and monitoring systems is to ensure that basic network functions are ful lled and 65598 volume 7 2019m usama et al unsupervised machine learning for networking techniques applications and research challenges table 8 anomaly network intrusion detection systems anids with respect to unsupervised learning techniques if there is any malfunctioning in the network it should be reported and addressed accordingly following is a summary of different network optimization tasks achieved through unsupervised learning models 1 qosqoe optimization qos and qoe are measures of service performance and end user experience respectively qos mainly deals with the performance as seen by the user being measured quantita tively while qoe is a qualitative measure of subjective met rics experienced by the user qosqoe for internet services especially multimedia content delivery services is crucial in order to maximize the user experience with the dynamic and bursty nature of internet traf c computer networks should be able to adapt to these changes without compromising enduser experiences as qoe is quite subjective it heavily relies on the underlying qos which is affected by different network parameters references 232 and 233 suggesteddifferent measurable factors to determine the overall approx imation of qos such as error rates bit rate throughput trans mission delay availability jitters etc furthermore these factors are used to correlate qos with qoe in the perspective of video streaming where qoe is essential to endusers the dynamic nature of the internet dictates network design for different applications to maximize qosqoe since there is no prede ned adaptive algorithm that can be used to ful ll all the necessary requirements for prospective application due to this fact ml approaches are employed in order to adapt to the realtime network conditions and take measures to stabilizemaximize the user experience reference 234 employed a hybrid architecture having unsupervised feature learning with a supervised classi cation for qoebased video admission control and resource management unsupervised feature learning in this system is carried out by using a fully connected nn comprising rbms which capture descriptive features of video that are later classi ed by using a supervised volume 7 2019 65599m usama et al unsupervised machine learning for networking techniques applications and research challenges classi er similarly 235 presents an algorithm to estimate the mean opinion score a metric for measuring qoe for voip services by using som to map quality metrics to features moreover research has shown that qoedriven content optimization leads to the optimal utilization of the network reference 236 showed that 43 of the bit overhead on average can be reduced per image delivered on the web this is achieved by using the quality metric voqs variation of quality signature which can arbitrarily compare two images in terms of web delivery performance by applying this met ric for unsupervised clustering of the large image dataset multiple coherent groups are formed in devicetargeted and contentdependent manner in another study 237 deep learning is used to assess the qoe of 3d images that have yet to show good results compared with the other determin istic algorithms the outcome is a reduced reference qoe assessment process for automatic image assessment and it has a signi cant potential to be extended to work on 3d video assessment in 238 a unique technique of the modelbased rl approach is applied to improve bandwidth availability and hence throughput performance of a network the mrl model is embedded in a node that creates a model of the operating environment and uses it to generate virtual states and rewards for the virtual actions taken as the agent does not need to wait for the real states and rewards from the operating environment it can explore various kinds of actions on the virtual operating environment within a short period of time which helps to expedite the learning process and hence the convergence rate to the optimal action in 239 a marl approach is applied in which nodes exchange qvalues among themselves and select their respective next hop nodes with the best possible channel conditions while forwarding packets towards the destination this helps to improve throughput performance as nodes in a network ensure that packets are successfully sent to the destination in a collaborative manner 2 tcp optimization transmission control protocol tcp is the core endtoend protocol in tcpip stack that provides reliable ordered and errorfree delivery of messages between two communicating hosts due to the fact that tcp provides reliable and inorder delivery congestion control is one of the major concerns of this protocol which is commonly dealt with the algorithms de ned in rfc 5681 however classical congestion control algorithms are suboptimal in hybrid wiredwireless networks as they react to packet loss in the same manner in all net work situations in order to overcome this shortcoming of classical tcp congestion control algorithms an mlbased approach is proposed in 240 which employs a supervised classi er based on features learned for classifying a packet loss due to congestion or link errors other approaches to this problem currently employed in literature include using rl that uses fuzzy logic based reward evaluator based ongame theory 241 another promising approach named remy 242 uses a modi ed model of markov decision pro cess based on three factors 1 prior knowledge about the network 2 a traf c model based on user needs ie through put and delay and 3 an objective function that is to be maximized by this learning approach a customized best suited congestion control scheme is produced speci cally for that part of the network adapted to its unique requirements however classifying packet losses using unsupervised learn ing methods is still an open research problem and there is a need for realtime adaptive congestion control mechanism for multimodal hybrid networks for more applications refer to table 9 which classi es different various network optimization and operation works on the basis of their network type and the unsupervised learning technique used d dimensionality reduction visualization network data usually consists of multiple dimensions to apply machine learning techniques effectively the num ber of variables is needed to be reduced dimensionality reduction schemes have a number of signi cant potential applications in networks in particular dimensionality reduc tion can be used to facilitate network operations eg for anomalyintrusion detection reliability analysis or for fault prediction and network management eg through visual ization of highdimensional networking data a tabulated summary of various research works using dimensionality reduction techniques for various kinds of networking appli cations is provided in table 10 dimensionality reduction techniques have been used to improve the effectiveness of the anomalyintrusion detec tion system reference 255 proposed a ddos detection system in sdn

using replicator neural network proposed network is based on an encoder and decoder where the hidden layer between encoder and decoder performs the dimensionality reduction in an unsu pervised manner this process also corresponds to pca similarly 257 have proposed another anomaly detection procedure where dimensionality reduction for feature extrac tion is performed using multiscale pca and then using wavelet analysis so that the anomalous traf c is separated from the ow dimensionality reduction using robust pca based on minimum covariance determinant estimator for anomaly detection is presented in 258 259 applied pca for dimensionality reduction in network intrusion detec tion application to improve the performance of intrusion detection scheme another algorithm based on dimensionality reduction for new feature learning using pca is presented in 260 261 262 have reviewed the dimensionality reduction schemes for intrusion detection in multimedia traf c and proposed an

this revolution provid 65602 volume 7 2019m usama et al unsupervised machine learning for networking techniques applications and research challenges ing the aforementioned properties this subsection covers the recent applications of unsupervised ml techniques in sdns sons and iots 1 software defined networks sdn is a disruptive new networking architecture that sim pli es network operating and managing tasks and provides infrastructural support for novel innovations by making the network programmable 281 in simple terms the idea of programmable networks is to simply decouple the data for warding plane and controldecision plane which is rather tightly coupled in the current infrastructure the use of sdn can also be seen in managing and optimizing networks as network operators go through a lot of hassle to imple ment highlevel security policies in term of distributed low level system con gurations thus sdn resolves this issue by decoupling the planes and giving network operators bet ter control and visibility over network enabling them to make frequent changes to network state and providing sup port for highlevel speci cation language for network con trol 282 sdn is applicable in a wide variety of areas ranging from enterprise networks data centers infrastructure based wireless access networks optical networks to home and small businesses each providing many future research opportunities 281 unsupervised ml techniques are seeing a surging interest in sdn community as can be seen by a spate of recent work a popular application of unsupervised ml techniques in sdns relates to the application of intrusion detection and mit igation of security attacks 283 another approach for detect ing anomalies in a cloud environment using unsupervised learning model has been proposed by 284 that uses som to capture emergent system behavior and predict unknown and novel anomalies without any prior training or con guration a ddos detection system for sdn is presented in 255 where stacked autoencoders are used to detect ddos attacks a density peak based clustering algorithm for ddos attack is proposed as a new method to review the potentials of using sdn to develop an ef cient anomaly detection method 285 286 have recently presented an intelligent threat aware response system for sdn using reinforcement learning this work also recommends using unsupervised feature learning to improve the threat detection process another framework for anomaly detection classi cation and mitigation for sdn is presented in 287 where unsupervised learning is used fortraf c feature analysis reference 288 have presented a forensic framework for sdn and recommended kmeans clustering for anomaly detection in sdn another work 289 discusses the potential opportunities for using unsupervised learning for traf c classi cation in sdn moreover deep learning and distributed processing can also be applied to such models in order to better adapt to evolving networks and contribute to the future of sdn infrastructure as a service 2 self organizing networks son is another new and popular research regime in network ing son is inspired by the biological system which worksin the selforganization and achieves the task by learning from the surrounding environment as the connected net work devices are growing exponentially and the communi cation cell size has reduced to femtocells the property of selforganization is becoming increasingly desirable 290 feasibility of son application in the fth generation 5g of wireless communication is studied in 291 and the study shows that without supervised as well as unsupervised ml support son is not possible application of ml tech niques in son has become a very important research area as it involves learning from the surroundings for intelligent decisionmaking and reliable communication 2 application of different mlbased son for heterogeneous networks is considered in 292 this paper also describes the unsupervised ann and hidden markov models tech niques employed for better learning from the surroundings and adapting accordingly pca and clustering are the two most used unsupervised learning schemes utilized for param eter optimization and feature learning in son 290 these ml schemes are used in selfcon guration selfhealing and selfoptimization schemes game theory is another unsuper vised learning approach used for designing selfoptimization and greedy selfcon guration design of son systems 293 authors in 294 proposed an unsupervised ann for link quality estimation of son which outperformed simple mov ing average and exponentially weighted moving averages 3 internet of things iot is an emerging paradigm with a growing academic and industry interest iot is an abstraction of intelligent phys ical and virtual devices with unique identities connected together to form a cyberphysical framework these devices collect analyze and transmit data to public or private cloud for intelligent 295 iot is a new networking paradigm and it is expected to be deployed in health care smart cities home automation agriculture and industry with such a vast plane of applications iot needs ml to collect and analyze data to make intelligent decisions the key challenge that iot must deal with is the extremely large scale billions of devices of future iot deployments",

on some open directions for future work and the relevant opportunities in applying unsupervised ml in the eld of networking a simplified network management while new network architectures such as sdn have been proposed in recent years to simplify network management network operators are still expected to know too much and to correlate between what they know about how their network is designed with the current networks condition through their monitoring sources operators who manage these requirements by wrestling with complexity manu ally will de nitely welcome any respite that they can get from semiautomated unsupervised machine learning as highlighted in by 303 for ml to become pervasive in networking the semantic gapwhich refers to the key challenge of transferring ml results into actionable insights and reports for the network operatormust be overcome this can facilitate a shift from a reactive interaction style for network management where the network manager is expected to check maps and graphs when things go wrong to aproactive one where automated reports and noti cationsare created for different services and network regions ideally this would be abstract yet informative such as google maps directions eg there is heavier traf c than usual on your route as well as suggestions about possible actions this could be coupled with an automated correlation of different reports coming from different parts of the network this will require a move beyond mere noti cations and visualizations to more substantial synthesis through which potential sources of problems can be identi ed another example relates to making measurements more useroriented most users would be more interested in qoe instead of qos ie how the current condition of the network affects their applications and services rather than just raw qos metrics the development of measurement objectives should be from a businesseyeball perspectiveand not only through presenting statistics gath ered through various tools and protocols such as traceroute ping bgp etc with the burden of putting the various pieces of knowledge together being on the user b semisupervised learning for computer networks semisupervised learning lies between supervised and unsu pervised learning the idea behind semisupervised learning is to improve the learning ability by using unlabeled data incorporation with a small set of labeled examples in com puter networks semisupervised learning is partially used in anomaly detection and traf c classi cation and has great potential to be used with deep unsupervised learning archi tectures like generative adversarial networks for improving the state of the art in anomaly detection and traf c classi cation similarly user behavior learning for cybersecurity can also be tackled in a semisupervised fashion a semi supervised learning based anomaly detection approach is pre sented in 304 the presented approach used large amounts of unlabeled samples together with labeled samples to build a better intrusion detection classi er in particular a single hidden layer feedforward nn has trained to output a fuzzy membership vector the results show that using unla beled samples help signi cantly improve the classi ers performance in another work 305 have proposed semi supervised learning with 97 accuracy to lter out non malicious data in millions of queries that domain name service dns servers receive c transfer learning in computer networks transfer learning is an emerging ml technique in which knowledge learned from one problem is applied to a different but related problem 306 although it is often thought that for ml algorithms the training and future data must be in the same feature space and must have the same distribution this is not necessarily the case in many realworld applica tions in such cases it is desirable to have transfer learn ingor knowledge transfer between the different task domains transfer learning has been successfully applied in computer vision and nlp applications but its implementation for net working has not been witnessedeven though in principle this can be useful in networking as well due to

next big thing in cloud networks as they ensure the privacy of the user data and less computation on the cloud to reduce the cost and energy 308 system and method for network address management in the federated cloud are presented in 309 and the application of federated iot and cloud computing for health care is presented in 310 an endtoend security architecture for federated cloud and iot is presented in 311 e generative adversarial networks gans in computer networks adversarial networksbased on generative adversarial net work gan training originally proposed by goodfellow and colleagues at the university of montreal 312have recently emerged as a new technique using which machines can be trained to predict outcomes by only the observing the world without necessarily being provided labeled data an adversarial network has two nn models a generator which is responsible for generating some type of data from some random input and a discriminator which has the task of distinguishing between input from the generator or a real data set the two nns optimize themselves together resulting in a more realistic generation of data by the generator and a better sense of what is plausible in the real world for the discrimina tor reference 313 proposed a gan for generating malware examples to attack a malware classi er and then proposes a defense against it another adversarial perturbation attack on malware classi er is proposed in 314 the use of gans for ml in networking can improve the performance of mlbased networking applications such as anomaly detection in which malicious users have an incentive to adversarial craft new attacks to avoid detection by network managers v pitfalls and caveats of using unsupervised ml in networking with the bene ts and intriguing results of unsupervised learn ing there also exist many shortcomings that are not addressed widely in the literature some potential pitfalls and caveats related to unsupervised learning are discussed next a inappropriate technique selection to start with the rst potential pitfall could be the selection of technique different unsupervised learning and predicting techniques may have excellent results on some applications while performing poorly on othersit is important to choose the best technique for the task at hand another reason could be a poor selection of features or parameters on

decisions made by ml is especially important for the operational success of ml in largescale operational networks and its acceptance by operators net work managers and users but prediction accuracy and sim plicity are often in con ict 315 as an example the greater accuracy of nns accrues from its complex nature in which input variables are combined in a nonlinear fashion to build a complicated

mind a common pitfall that aca demic researchers may suffer from which is not realizing that 2httpswwwdarpamilprogramexplainablearti cialintelligence volume 7 2019 65605m usama et al unsupervised machine learning for networking techniques applications and research challenges figure 8 intuitively we expect the ml models performance to improve with more data but to deteriorate in performance if the model becomes overly complex for the data figure adapted from 317 network operators may have simpler nonmachine learning based solutions that may work as well as naive mlbased solutions in practical settings failure to examine the ground realities of operational networks will undermine the effec tiveness of mlbased solutions we should expect mlbased solutions to augment and supplement rather than replace other nonmachinelearning based solutionsat least for the foreseeable future e overfitting another potential issue with unsupervised models is over t ting it corresponds to a model representing the noise or ran dom error rather than learning the actual pattern in data while commonly associated with supervised ml the prob lem of over tting lurks whenever we learn from data and thus is applicable to unsupervised ml as well as illustrated in figure 8 ideally speaking we expect ml algorithms to provide improved performance with more data but with increasing model complexity performance starts to deterio rate after a certain pointalthough it is possible to get poorer results empirically with increasing data when working with unoptimized outofthebox ml algorithms 317 according to the occam razor principle the model complexity should be commensurate with the amount of data available and with overly complex models the ability to predict and generalize diminishes two major reasons for over tting could be the overly large size of the learning model and fewer sample data used for training purposes generally data is divided into two portions actual data and stochastic noise due to the unavailability of labels or related information unsupervised learning model can over t the data which causes issues in testing and deployment phase crossvalidation regulariza tion and chisquared testing are highly recommended for designing or tweaking an unsupervised learning algorithm to avoid over tting 318 f data quality issues it should be noted that all ml is data dependent and the per formance of ml algorithms is affected largely by the nature volume quality and representation of data in the case of unsupervised ml data quality issues must be carefully con sidered since any problem with the data quality will seriouslymar the performance of ml algorithms a potential prob lem is that dataset may be imbalanced if the samples size from one class is very much smaller or larger than the other classes 319 in such imbalanced datasets the algorithm must be careful not to ignore the rare class by assuming it to be noise although imbalanced datasets are more of a nuisance for supervised learning techniques they may also pose problems for unsupervised and semisupervised learn ing techniques g inaccurate model building it is dif cult to build accurate and generic models since each model is optimized for certain kind of applications unsupervised ml models should be applied after carefully studying the application and the suitability of the algorithm in such settings 320 for example we highlight certain issues related to the unsupervised task of clustering 1 random initialization in kmeans is not recommended 2 number of clusters is not known before the clustering operation as we do not have labels 3 in the case of hierarchical clustering we do not know when to stop and this can cause increase in the time complexity of the process and 4 evaluating the clustering result is very tricky since the ground truth is mostly unknown h machine learning in adversarial environments many networking problems such as anomaly detection are adversarial problems in which the malicious intruder is con tinually trying to outwit the network administrators and the tools used by the network administrators in such settings machine learning that learns from historical data may not perform due to clever crafting of attacks speci cally for circumventing any schemes based on previous data due to these challenges pitfalls and weaknesses due care must be exercised while using unsupervised and semi supervised ml these pitfalls can be avoided in part by using various best practices 321 such as endtoend learning pipeline testing visualization of

backscatter light as a function of time from the initial pulse injection performance metrics for comparing and contrasting various approaches in optical time domain reflectometery exists and primarily uses one way fiber attenuation range ldb which results in a reflectometer output snr of unity 1 as the users of optical fiber have migrated to longer transmission wavelengths because of lower loss and as higher quality fibers have become available there is literally less backscattered light to be measured 5 event detection and classification becomes tough for minute reflections in otdr signal processing as the rayleigh backscatter is about 45db lower than the launch power variety of techniques has been used to detect such weak signals a composite coding scheme for snr enhancement has been used for such weak signal detection and tested for our inhouse built otdr the notion lies in combining complementary correlation codes with the simplex codes to achieve higher gain than conventional coding techniques 67 research in the postprocessing algorithm for otdr revolves around the ways of improving the method of extracting the event information and features from the otdr signature in this paper an algorithm is presented for the detection of the discontinuities in otdr signature that will describe optical fiber attenuation characteristic buried in high level additive signal such algorithms are employed to post process the output of an otdr that will not only locate the position of the connector splice crack bend and cut along the fiber it will also provide loss characteristic of each individual event an otdr output consists of two parameters the distance in km and attenuation in db an otdr plot its output in a graph format on the otdr screen with distance on xaxis and attenuation on yaxis a conventional otdr trace is shown in figure 1 fig 1 examplary otdr trace in upcoming sections existing techniques for post processing of otdr data our proposed methodology and experimental testbed is discussed followed by a section on main requirements for post processing and finally the achieved results are quantified in the experimental results section ii e xisting event

backscatter data are identified and extracted a general rule with least square approximation is that an events magnitude should be at least double the magnitude of noise to be accurately located 8 if data is very noisy the line fitted to the data may not represent the true slope and would produce inaccurate results the accuracy of processing is difficult to ensure in acquired low snr data b wavelet analysis wavelet analysis method is used for finding discontinuities in the otdr signatures data curve data is subjected to wavelet transform and the coefficients are subjected to a threshold

maximum mold algorithm 9 the whole process is summarized in the figure 2 fig 2 event detection using wavelet transform another approach using morlets complex wavelet transform has also been used which incorporates two important properties a the phase of the wavelet transform wt of an exponentially decaying function ft is independent of time shifting since ft is a homogeneous function b the phase of the wt of a gaussian white noise has a special distribution in property a is applied for estimating attenuation parameters and property b is used to identify end of fiber a binary detection criterion is established based on phase of wt of the otdr data to detect events morlets complex wavelet transform approach faces difficulties in limited operation time and uncertainty in detected events",

was used as an optical source and laser power was coupled into the fiber spool by using a fiber directional coupler an ingaas pin photo diode receiver was used to detect the response from the fiber to the front end a transimpedance amplifier is used to convert the receivers current into voltage then a 12bit two port adc was used to sample the incoming voltage to 20mbps with a 12 bit resolution offering enough dynamic range to detect the events properly whole assembly source coupler receiver tia and adc was built on the daughter board called analog front end afe showed in figure 3 fig 3 afe daughter board for signal processing an onboard signal processor blackfin bf532 dsp was used which performs control decoding and post signal processing functions meanwhile xilinx spartan iii fpga was also used to perform downconversion of 20mbps for the processor and additionally fpga control triggering capturing received optical signals and averaging fpga is controlled by adsp which uses its control signals to initiate the acquisition process whole assembly adsp fpga and memories was built on a separate board as shown in figure 4 fig 4 signal processing board afe and signal processing

sram after that averaging is performed to get the final trace and then post processing algorithm is employed to extract events v p ost processing of otdr data a offset compensation once the trace is acquired it needs to be converted in final presentable form by performing logarithmic operation on the otdr signal the logarithmic operations are sensitive to any fixeddc offset added to the signal all adcs have some inherent fixeddc offset which is defined as the difference between the ideal least significant bit lsb transition to the actual transition point if the offset is not properly removed the logged trace rolls up when the backscatter reaches the noise floor it is necessary to remove the adc offset before post processing after the offset is removed the final trace needs to be analyzed for events and their parameters offset compensation is an important task in post processing of acquired traces as it ensures offset errors removed and a linear trace display b trace analysis the purpose of the trace analysis step is to find different reflective and nonreflective events along the fiber and to measure their locations and losses nonreflective events are of two types namely loss and gain for each nonreflective event the insertion loss is measured the accurate method of determining the nonreflective event is to find four marker locations two before the event and two after the event for each nonreflective event the insertion loss il needs to be measured the accurate method for determining the loss is to find four marker locations two before the event and two after the event least square ls fits are found for sections of fiber between each pair of markers as shown in figure 6 nococi 2013 isbn 9781467358224 259 authorized licensed use limited to national university

loss is found as the difference between the two fits from which expected fiber loss needs to be subtracted a user defined input loss threshold puts a lower limit for the identification of a nonreflective event reflective events begin with a slope rising sharply hitting the peak and then falling back to the normal value this identifies reflective event vi e xperimental results in this section the experimental results are discussed which are gathered by employing proposed post processing algorithm to the otdr data from live optical fibers of 100km each named as fiber under test fut1 and fut2 once the signatures are acquired and converted into the final presentable form by performing filtering averaging correlation and logarithmic operations they need to be analyzed for events since the logarithmic operation is sensitive to any fixeddc offset that may have been added to the otdr signal the source of such offset is usually the adc all adcs have some inherent offset value if the offset is not removed properly the logged trace rolls up or down when the backscatter reaches the noise floor level it is very important point in acquiring the final trace that offset must be removed the signature of fut1 is given in figure 7 fig 7 signature of fiber under test fut1 after the post processing algorithm the resultant detected events are shown by the normalized bar plot in figure 8 fig 8 bar plot of detected events in fut1 similarly proposed algorithm is applied on fut2 and results are gathered the trace plot and detected events for fut2 are shown in figure 9 and 10 respectively fig 9 signature of fut2 fig 10 bar plot of detected events in fut2 results are compared in terms of distance with the actual values of distance and the values of the events from
